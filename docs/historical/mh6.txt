                                                     Abstract

              This  document  describes  the  user-visible  change  to  the  UCI  ver-
         sion of the Rand MH     system that were made from mh.5     to MH     #6.5.
         It  is  based  on  the  mh.6    changes  document,  but  has  been  updated  to
         accurately reflect the MH     distributed with 4.3bsd UNIX1 . This docu-
         ment  does  not  describe  bug-fixes,  per  se,  or  internal  changes,  unless
         these activities resulted in a visible change for the MH     user.
              This  document  is  meant  to  supplement,  not  supersede,  the  stan-
         dard MH     User's manual[MRose85       ].
              Comments concerning this documentation should be addressed to
         the Internet mailbox Bug-MH@ICS.UCI.EDU.

Acknowledgements


The MH     system described herein is based on the original Rand MH     system.

It has been extensively developed (perhaps too much so) by Marshall T. Rose

and  John  L.  Romine  at  the  University  of  California,  Irvine.  Einar  A.  Stef-

ferud,  Jerry  N.  Sweet,  and  Terry  P.  Domae  provided  numerous  suggestions

to improve the UCI version of MH    .  Of course, a large number of people have

helped MH     along.  The list of "MH     immortals" is too long to list here.  How-

ever, Van Jacobson deserves a special acknowledgement for his tireless work

in improving the performance of MH    .  Some programs have been speeded-up

by a factor of 10 or 20.  All of users of MH    , everywhere, owe a special thanks

to Van.

Conventions


In this document, certainaL TE X    -formatting conventions are adhered to:


     1.  The  names  of  UNIX  commands,  such  as  comp    ,  are  presented  in  text

         italics.


     2.  Arguments  to  programs,  such  as  `msgs',  are  presented  in  typewriter

         style and delimited by single-quotes.


     3.  UNIX pathnames and envariables, such as


                                   /usr/uci/             and          $SIGNATURE              ;


         are presented in slanted roman.


     4.  Text presenting an example, such as



                 comp  -editor  zz



         is presented in typewriter  style.

General  Changes


Unlike  the  changes  between  mh.4     and  mh.5   ,  a  large  number  of  user-visible

changes  have  been  made  in  mh.6   .  These  changes  have  been  in  the  form  of

bug  fixes  and  several  generalizations.  The  majority  of  these  will  not  affect

novice users.  In addition, mh.6     is a great deal faster than mh.5    :  all programs

have been speeded-up significantly, thanks to work done by Van Jacobson as

part of the process of including mh.6     in the 4.3bsd UNIX distribution.

      This document describes all user-visible changes to mh.5     from it's initial

release to the intermediate release of MH     #6.5.



System-5  Support


In addition to support for bsd UNIX, V7 UNIX and Xenix2  variants of UNIX,

MH     finally has support for the AT&T variant of UNIX, System 5.  Hopefully

this will greatly expand the number of system which can run MH    .  Ironically,

it  appears  that  five  ports  of  earlier  versions  of  MH     (including  mh.5   )  were

done, but news of the work was not widespread.3



Documentation


Several  new  documents  have  been  included  in  the  mh.6     distribution:   The

paper MH.5:  How to process 200 messages a day and still get some real work

done  was  presented  at  the  1985  Summer  Usenix  Conference  and  Exhibition

in  Portland,  Orgeon.  Another  paper,  MH:  A  Multifarious  User  Agent,  has

been accepted for publication by Computer Networks.  Both describe MH    , the

former from a more technical and somewhat humorous perspective, the latter

from  a  more  serious  and  research-oriented  perspective.  In  addition,  a  third

paper  has  been  included,  Design  of  the  TTI  Prototype  Trusted  Mail  Agent,

which  describes  a  so-called  "trusted"  mail  agent  built  on  top  of  MH   .   This

paper  was  presented  at  the  Second  International  Symposium  on  Computer

Message Systems in Washington, D.C. A fourth paper, MZnet:  Mail Service

for  Personal  Micro-Computer  Systems,  is  also  included.  This  paper,  which

knowledge of the others' work.

was  presented  at  the  First  International  Symposium  on  Computer  Message

Systems in Nottingham, U.K., describes a CP/M4 -based version of MH    .

      In  addition,  the  MH     tutorial,  The  Rand  MH  Message  Handling  System:

Tutorial,  and,  The  Rand  MH  Message  Handling  System:  The  UCI  BBoards

Facility, have both been updated by Jerry N. Sweet.

      For  MH     administrators  (PostMasters  and  the  like),  there's  an  entirely

new  document,  The  Rand  MH  Message  Handling  System:  Administrator's

Guide.  It explains most of the "ins and outs" of maintaining an MH     system.

      Finally, all of the manual entries and the MH     manual have had a thorough

working  over.   The  documentation  is  expanded,  more  accurate,  and  more

detailed.



Help  Listings


When  any  MH     command  is  invoked  with  the  `-help'  switch,  in  addition  to

listing  the  syntax  of  the  command  and  version  information,  the  MH     config-

uration  options  will  be  listed.  MH     has  so  many  configuration  options,  that

when debugging problems, this information is invaluable.



The  MH       Profile


There are two new profile entries worth noting:  MH-Sequences tells MH     the

name  of  the  file  to  record  public  sequences  in.   Users  of  vm  ,  a  proprietary,

visual  front-end  to  MH    ,  make  use  of  this  to  disable  the  public  sequences

feature of MH    .

      The profile entry Unseen-Sequence names those sequences which should

be defined as those messages recently incorporated by inc  .  The show     program

knows to remove messages from this sequence once it thinks they have been

seen.  If  this  profile  entry  is  not  present,  or  is  empty,  then  no  sequences  are

defined.  Otherwise, for each name given, the sequence is first zero'd and then

each  message  incorporated  is  added  to  the  sequence.   As  such,  this  profile

entry is rather analogous to the Previous-Sequence entry in the user's MH

profile.

      In  addition,  the  Alternate-Mailboxes  entry  in  the  profile  has  been  ex-

panded to support simple wild-carding.  Also, the default for this profile entry

is  now  the  user's  mail-id  at  any  host.  This  change  was  made  since  MH     can

no longer reliably figure out what the user's real outgoing address looks like.

      Finally, when the install-mh       program is automatically invoked by MH    , it

won't prompt the user for information.  Instead, it notes that it's setting up

the  default  environment.   In  addition,  the  MH     administrator  may  set-up  a

file called mh.profile       in the MH     library area which is consulted by install-mh

when initializing the user's .mh__profile      .



The  MH       Context


The folder   , scan   , and show     programs have been modified to update the user's

MH     context prior to writing to the user's terminal.  This allows the MH     user

interrupt output to the terminal and still have the expected context.  This is

especially useful to interrupt long scan     listings.  This change also introduces

a subtle bug between show     and messages denoted by the Unseen-Sequence.

See show    (1) for the details.



Addresses  and  822  support


MH     now fully supports the RFC-822 routing syntax for addresses (it used to

recognize the syntax, but ignore the information present).  In addition, there

are three major modes for support of non-822 addressing in MH    :


      -  BERK

         This  is  useful  on  sites  running  SendMail      .  It  doesn't  support  full  822-

         style  addressing,  in  favor  of  recognizing  such  formats  as  ACSnet,  and

         so on.  For sites that can't run in an 822-compliant environment, this is

         the option to use (at the price of sacrificing some of the power of 822-

         style addressing).  This also drastically reduces the address formatting

         facilities described below.


      -  DUMB

         Although not as liberal as BERK, the DUMB option is useful on sites

         in  which  the  message  transport  system  conforms  to  the  822  standard,

         but wants to do all the defaulting itself.


      -  BANG

         From out in left field, the BANG option favors UUCP      -style addressing



                                                           6




         over  822-style  addressing.  Hopefully  when  all  the  UUCP      sites  around

         get  around  to  adopting  domain-style  addresses,  this  option  won't  be

         needed.


      The ap   program (mentioned momentarily) and the ali  program both sup-

port  a  `-normalize'  switch  indicate  if  addresses  should  be  resolved  to  their

"official" hostnames.



New  Programs


There  are  five  new  programs  available:  The  ap   program  is  the  MH     stand-

alone address parser.  It's useful for printing address in various formats (and

for  debugging  address  strings).   The  dp   program  is  similar,  but  works  on

dates instead of addresses.

      The msgchk       program checks for new mail, possibly using the Post Office

Protocol, POP, described below.

      A  new  receive  mail  hook,  the  rcvstore      program,  which  was  written  by

Julian L. Onions is available.

      Finally,  a  visual  front-end  to  msh    called  vmh     has  been  included.   (This

program is discussed in greater detail later on.)



Message  Numbering


MH     now  no  longer  restricts  the  number  of  messages  which  may  reside  in  a

folder (beyond that of system memory constraints).  This means that message

numbers larger than 2000 are permissible.  Hopefully this will make life easier

for people reading the network news using MH    .



The  WhatNow  Shell


In  mh.6   ,  there  is  now  the  concept  of  a  unified  What  now?   processor  that

the  four  composition  programs,  comp    ,  dist ,  forw   ,  and  repl   all  invoke.   This

permits  a  greater  flexibility  in  building  mail  applications  with  MH    .   As  a

result, there's a new program, whatnow       , which acts as the default What  now?

program.  Consult the whatnow       (1) manual entry for all the details.  The only

important user-visible change is the headers option went away, which wasn't

used that much anyway.



                                                           7




      The  only  other  thing  worth  noting  is  that  unless  MH    has  been  compiled

with  the  UCI  option,  the  user's  $HOME/.signature               file  is  not  consulted  for

the user's personal name.



Format  Strings


A  general  format  string  facility  has  been  added  to  allow  MH     users  to  tailor

the output of certain commands.

      The  inc ,  scan   ,  ap ,  and  dp   programs  all  consult  a  file  containing  format

strings.  Format strings, which look a lot like printf    (3) strings, give these MH

commands precise instructions on how to format their output.

      As  a  result,  the  inc   and  scan    programs  no  longer  have  the  `-size',  `-

nosize',  `-time',  `-notime',  `-numdate',  and  `-nonumdate'  switches.   These

switches  have  been  replaced  with  the  `-form formatfile'  switch  and  the

`-format string'  switch.   The  former  directs  the  program  to  consult  the

named file for the format strings.  The latter directs the program to use the

named  string  as  the  format.  To  get  the  behavior  of  the  old  `-time'  option,

use the `-form scan.time' option.  Similarly, to get the effect of `-size', use

`-form scan.size'.

      A fun form to use is `-form scan.timely' with scan   .  Try it sometime.

      The repl   command uses a file containing format files to indicate how the

reply  draft  should  be  constructed.  Note  that  reply  templates  prior  to  mh.6

are incompatible with mh.5    .5  Don't worry though, it's quite easy to convert

the templates by hand.  (Those clever enough to have written a reply template

to begin with won't have any  problem.)

      Similarly,  when  the  forw    program  is  constructing  a  digest,  it  uses  a  file

containing format strings to indicate how to build the encapsulating draft.

      Finally, you can use these facilities in mhl    as well.



News


The depreciated MH     news system (from mh.1    ) is now de-supported.  Use the

"hoopy" BBoards facility instead.
________________________________________________
    5 In fact, reply templates between mh.6    and MH    #6.5 are imcompatible.



                                                           8




BBoards


MH     maintainers take note:  the default home directory for the bboards login

has  changed  from  /usr/bboards/           to  /usr/spool/bboards/              .   Use  the  bbhome

directive  in  your  MH    configuration  file  to  set  it  back  to  the  old  value  if  you

wish.

      In  addition,  the  aliases  field  for  a  BBoard  in  the  BBoards  file  is  now

deemed  useful  only  for  addressing,  not  for  user  input  to  bbc  .   This  means

when  giving  the  name  of  a  BBoard  to  bbc ,  only  the  official  name  should  be

used.

      A  final  note  for  mailsystem  maintainers:   the  MMDF-II         BBoards  chan-

nel  and  the  SendMail       BBoards  mailer  have  been  modified  to  use  the  stan-

dard message encapsulation format when returning failed messages to the list

maintainer.  This means that the failure notices that the maintainer receives

can simply be burst   .



New  Switches  in  bbc


The bbc   program permits you to specify the mshproc to use on the command

line by using the `-mshproc program' option.  There's also a `-rcfile file'

option  which  does  "the  obvious  thing".   In  addition,  options  which  aren't

understood by bbc   are passed along to the mshproc.

      In  addition,  the  following  commands  pass  any  unrecognized  switches  on

to the program that they invoke:  bbc  , next   , show    , prev   , and vmh    .



Distributed  BBoards


If both BBoards and POP (see the next section) are enabled, then distributed

BBoards  can  be  supported  on  top  of  the  POP  service.  This  allows  the  MH

user  to  read  BBoards  on  a  server  machine  instead  of  the  local  host  (which

saves  a  lot  of  wasted  disk  space  when  the  same  BBoards  are  replicated  sev-

eral  times  at  a  site  with  several  hosts).   See  the  Administrator's  Guide  for

information on how this can be made completely transparent to the MH     user.

      If you have several machines at your site running 4.2bsd UNIX and con-

nected by an Ethernet6  (or other high-speed LAN), you want  this software.

Visual  Front-End  to  msh


A  simple  window  management  protocol  has  been  implemented  for  MH     pro-

grams  that  might  wish  to  act  as  a  back-end  to  a  sophisticated  visual  front-

end.

      The  first  implementation  of  a  server  side  (front-end)  program  is  vmh   ,

which uses curses    (3) to maintain a split-screen interface.  Perhaps look for a

mhtool      program for the SUN next!

      The  msh    program  has  been  modified  to  speak  the  client  side  (back-end)

of  this  protocol,  if  so  directed.  At  present,  msh    is  the  only  program  in  the

MH     distribution which implements the client side of the window management

protocol.



Updates  in  msh


Prior to quitting, the msh     command now asks if the packf    'd file you've been

perusing  should  be  updated  if  you've  modified  it  and  the  file  is  writable  by

you.  The file can be modified by using burst   , rmm     , rmm     , or sortm     commands.

The file can also be modified by using the refile   command without the `-link'

option.  (Or  course,  the  `-link'  option  doesn't  actually  link  anything  to  the

file.)



Distributed  Mail


MH     now  contains  a  powerful  facility  for  doing  distributed  mail  (having  MH

reside  on  a  host  different  than  the  message  transport  agent).   For  general

information,  consult  either  the  MH.5:  How  to  process  200  messages  a  day

and  still  get  some  real  work  done  paper,  or  the  MH:  A  Multifarious  User

Agent  paper.   For  specific  information,  consult  the  Administrator's  Guide.

Here's a brief synopsis:

      This  POP  facility  in  MH     is  based  on  a  modification  of  the  ARPA  Post

Office Protocol (POP). A POP subscriber  is a remote user, on a POP client

host, that wishes to pick-up mail on a POP service  host.

      There are two ways to administer POP:


      -  Naive Mode

         Each user-id in the passwd      (5) file is considered a POP subscriber.  No



                                                           10




         changes are required for the mailsystem on the POP service host.  How-

         ever,  this  method  requires  that  each  POP  subscriber  have  an  entry  in

         the password file.  The POP server will fetch the user's mail from wher-

         ever  maildrops  are  kept  on  the  POP  service  host.  This  means  that  if

         maildrops  are  kept  in  the  user's  home  directory,  then  each  POP  sub-

         scriber must have a home directory.


      -  Smart Mode

         This  is  based  on  the  notion  that  the  list  of  POP  subscribers  and  the

         list  of  login  users  are  completely  separate  name  spaces.   A  separate

         database (similar to the BBoards       (5) file) is used to record information

         about each POP subscriber.  Unfortunately, the local mailsystem must

         be  changed  to  reflect  this.   This  requires  two  changes  (both  of  which

         are simple):


             1.  Aliasing

                 The aliasing mechanism is augmented so that POP subscriber ad-

                 dresses  are  diverted  to  a  special  delivery  mechanism.  MH     comes

                 with  a  program,  popaka    (8),  which  generates  the  additional  infor-

                 mation to be put in the mailsystem's alias file.

             2.  Delivery

                 A special POP delivery channel (for MMDF-II       ) or POP mailer (for

                 SendMail      )  performs  the  actual  delivery  (mh.6     supplies  both).  All

                 it really does is just place the mail in the POP spool area.


         Clever  mailsystem  people  will  note  that  the  POP  mechanism  is  really

         a special case of the more general BBoards mechanism.


These two different philosophies are not compatible on the same POP service

host:  one or the other, but not both, may be run.

      In  addition,  there  is  one  user-visible  difference,  which  the  administrator

controls  the  availability  of.   The  difference  is  whether  the  POP  subscriber

must supply a password to the POP server:


      -  ARPA standard method

         This  uses  the  standard  ARPA  technique  of  sending  a  username  and  a

         password.  The  appropriate  programs  (inc  ,  msgchk     ,  and  possibly  bbc  )

         will prompt the user for this information.

      -  UNIX remote method

         This uses the Berkeley UNIX reserved port method for authentication.

         This requires that the two or three mentioned above programs be setuid

         to root.  (There are no known holes in any of these programs.)


These  two  different  philosophies  are  compatible  on  the  same  POP  service

host:  to selectively disable RPOP for hosts which aren't trusted, either mod-

ify the .rhosts     file in the case of POP subscribers being UNIX logins, or zero

the  contents  of  network  address  field  of  the  pop  (5)  file  for  the  desired  POP

subscribers.

      The  inc   command  also  has  two  other  switches  when  MH     is  enabled  for

POP: `-pack file' and `-nopack'.  Normally, inc   will use the POP to incor-

porate mail from a POP service host into an MH     folder (+inbox).  However,

there  are  some  misguided  individuals  who  prefer  to  msh    to  read  their  mail-

drop.  By  using  the  `-pack file'  option,  these  individuals  can  direct  inc   to

fetch  their  maildrop  from  the  POP  service  host  and  store  it  locally  in  the

named file.  As expected, inc   will treat the local file as a maildrop, performing

the  appropriate  locking  protocols.  And,  if  the  file  doesn't  exist,  the  user  is

now asked for confirmation.



Rcvmail  hooks


In order to offer users of MH     increased rcvmail hook functionality, the slocal

program has been upgraded to support the semantics of the MMDF-II         mail-

delivery  mechanism.   This  means  that  users  of  mh.6     can  maintain  identi-

cal  .maildelivery         files  regardless  of  the  underlying  transport  system.    See

mhook      (1) for all the details.



Change  in  rcvdist


The  rcvdist    rcvmail  hook  now  uses  the  MH     formatting  facility  when  redis-

tributing a message.



Field  change  in  rcvpack


The rcvpack      rcvmail hook now adds the field name Delivery-Date: instead

of Cron-Date: to messages it pack    s.

GNU  Emacs  Support


James  Larus'  mh-e     macro  package  for  GNU  Emacs  (version  17)  is  included

in the distribution.  When loaded in Emacs, this provides a handy front-end.



Other  Changes


Here's the miscellany:



Continuation  Lines


Alias files used by MH    , display templates used by mhl   , and format files used

by  forw  ,  repl ,  and  scan    all  support  a  standard  continuation  line  syntax.  To

continue  a  line  in  one  of  these  files,  simply  end  the  line  with  the  backslash

character  (`n').   All  the  other  files  used  by  MH     are  in  822-format,  so  the

822-continuation mechanism is used.7



Default  Date  Format


MH      now  uses  numeric  timezones  instead  of  locally-meaningful  alpha  time-

zones  when  generating  mail.   This  change  was  made  to  encourage  the  use

of  unambiguous,  globally-meaningful  timezone  strings.   A  local  configura-

tion option can disable this correct behavior.  All of the mhl    templates have

been  modified  to  use  locally-meaningful  alpha  timezones  when  displaying

messages.



New  switch  in  ali


The ali  command now has a `-noalias' switch to prevent system-wide aliases

from being interpreted.



Modifications  to  show


The `-format', `-noformat', `-pr', and `-nopr' options to show     have gone away

in favor of a more general mechanism.  The `-showproc program' option tells
________________________________________________
    7 Looking back, it would have been best had all files in MH    used the 822-format.

show      (or  next    or  prev   )  to  use  the  named  program  as  the  showproc.   The

`-noshowproc' option tells show    , et.  al., to use the cat  (1) program instead of

a showproc.  As a result, the profile entry prproc is no longer used.



Switch  change  in  inc


The  `-ms ms-file'  switch  in  inc   has  been  changed  to  `-file name'  to  be

more consistent.



Front-End  to  mhl


When  outputting  to  a  terminal,  the  mhl    program  now  runs  the  program

denoted  by  the  profile  entry  moreproc.    If  this  entry  is  not  present,  the

default  is  the  UCB  more     program.   If  the  entry  is  non-empty,  then  that

program is spliced between mhl    and the user's terminal.  The author uses the

less   program as his moreproc.

      Of  course,  if  mhl    isn't  outputting  to  a  terminal,  then  moreproc  is  not

invoked.

      Finally, to aid in the construction of replies, a prefix string may be speci-

fied for the body component of the message being replied-to.  Simply use the

component= construct in mhl    for body:.



Confirmation  in  packf


If the file specified by the `-file name' switch doesn't exist, the user is now

asked for confirmation.



Complex  Expressions  in  pick


The pick    command now handles complex boolean expressions.



Defaults  change  in  prompter  and  burst


The  `-prepend'  option  is  now  the  default  in  prompter      .   The  `-noinplace'

option is now the default in burst   .

Fcc:s  and  post


If multiple Fcc:s for a message are specified during posting, post   will try much

harder to preserve links.



Interactive  option  in  rmf


The  rmf    program  has  been  changed  to  support  an  `-interactive'  switch.

If  given,  then  the  user  is  prompted  regarding  whether  the  folder  should  be

deleted.  If  the  folder  to  be  removed  is  not  given  by  the  user,  this  switch  is

defaulted to on.



Trusted  Mail  Interface


MH     now has an interface for so-called "trusted mail" applications.  Although

the modifications to MH     to support this are in the public domain, the actual

library that MH     uses is not.  Contact Professor David J. Farber (Farber@UDel)

for more information.
