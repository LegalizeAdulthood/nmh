.TH MH-GEN 8 MH.6.8.4 [mh.6]
.SH NAME
mh-gen \- generating the MH system
.SH "READ THIS"
This documentation describes how to configure, generate, and install
the UCI version of the RAND \fIMH\fR system.  \fBBe certain\fP to 
read this document completely before you begin.  You probably will
also want to familiarize yourself with the \fIMH\fP Administrator's
Guide before you install \fIMH\fP.  A copy can be found in the
file \fBdoc/ADMIN.doc\fP is the \fIMH\fP sources.
.SH DISCLAIMER
Although the \fIMH\fR system was originally developed by the RAND Corporation,
and is now in the public domain,
the RAND Corporation assumes no responsibility for \fIMH\fR
or this particular modification of \fIMH\fR.
.PP
In addition,
the Regents of the University of California issue the following
\fBdisclaimer\fR in regard to the UCI version of \fIMH\fR:
.in +.5i
\*(lqAlthough each program has been tested by its contributor,
no warranty, express or implied,
is made by the contributor or the University of California,
as to the accuracy and functioning of the program
and related program material,
nor shall the fact of distribution constitute any such warranty,
and no responsibility is assumed by the contributor
or the University of California in connection herewith.\*(rq
.in -.5i
.PP
This version of \fIMH\fR is in the public domain,
and as such,
there are no real restrictions on its use.
The \fIMH\fR source code and documentation have no licensing restrictions
whatsoever.
As a courtesy,
the authors ask only that you provide appropriate credit to the RAND
Corporation and
the University of California for having developed the software.
.SH "GETTING HELP"
\fIMH\fR is a software package that is neither supported by the RAND
Corporation nor the University of California.
However,
since we do use the software ourselves and plan to continue using (and
improving) \fIMH\fR,
bug reports and their associated fixes should be reported back to us so that
we may include them in future releases.
The current computer mailbox for \fIMH\fR is \fBBug\-MH@@ICS.UCI.EDU\fR.
Current information about MH can be obtained from
the \fBMH Home Page\fP on the World Wide Web at
\fBhttp://www.ics.uci.edu/~mh\fP.
.PP
Presently,
there are two Internet discussion groups, \fBMH\-Users@@ICS.UCI.EDU\fR
and \fBMH\-Workers@@ICS.UCI.EDU\fR.  \fBMH\-Workers\fP is for people
discussing code changes to \fIMH\fP.  \fBMH-Users\fP is for general
discussion about how to use \fIMH\fP.
\fBMH\-Users\fR is bi-directionally 
gatewayed into USENET as \fBcomp.mail.mh\fR.
.SH "HOW TO GET MH"
Since you probably already have \fIMH\fP,
you may not need to read this unless you suspect you have an old version.
There are two ways to get the latest release:
.PP
1.  If you can FTP to the ARPA Internet, use anonymous FTP to
ftp.ics.uci.edu and retrieve the file pub/mh/mh-6.8.tar.Z.
This is a tar image after being run through the compress program
(approximately 1.8MB).  There should also be a \fBREADME\fR file in
that directory which tells what the current release of \fIMH\fP
is, and how to get updates.
.PP
You may also find MH on
various other hosts; to make sure you get the latest version and
don't waste your time re-fixing bugs, it's best to get it from
either ftp.ics.uci.edu or a site that mirrors ftp.ics.uci.edu.
.PP
2.  You can send $75 US to the address below.
This covers the cost of a 6250 BPI 9-track magtape,
handling, and shipping.  In addition, you'll get a
laser-printed hard-copy of the entire MH documentation set.  Be
sure to include your USPS address with your check.  Checks 
must be drawn on U.S\&. funds and should be made payable to:

.ti +1i
Regents of the University of California

The distribution address is:  

.nf
.RS 1i
Attn: MH distribution
Office of Academic Computing
Univeristy of California at Irvine
Irvine, CA  92717-2225  USA

+1 714 824 5153
.fi
.RE
.PP
Sadly, if you just want the hard-copies of the documentation, you
still have to pay the $75.  The tar image has the documentation
source (the manual is in roff format, but the rest are in TeX
format).  Postscript formatted versions of the TeX papers are 
available, as are crude tty-conversions of those papers.
.SH SYNOPSIS
MAKE
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a description of how one can bring up an \fIMH\fR system.
It is assumed that you have super-user privileges in order to
(re\-)install \fIMH\fR.
Super-user privileges are not required to configure or generate \fIMH\fR.
.PP
Become the super-user and cd to /usr/src/local/
(or whatever you keep your local sources).
The distribution tape contains the hierarchy for the mh.6-8/ directory.
Bring the sources on-line:
.sp 1
.nf
# cd /usr/src/local
% tar xv
% cd mh-6.8
.fi
.SH CONFIGURATION
First, go to the conf/ directory.
.sp 1
.nf
% cd conf/
.fi
.sp 1
This directory contains files that will produce source files tailored
for your choice of \fIMH\fR configuration.
You should edit only the file \fBMH\fR.
This file contains configuration directives.
These configuration directives are read by the \fImhconfig\fR program to
produce customized files.
.sp
For examples of various configurations,
look in the directory \fBconf/examples/\fR.
The file \fBMH\fR provided in \fBconf/\fR is a reasonable default.
Lines beginning with `#' are comments, and are not otherwise interpreted.
.PP
Here are the \fIMH\fP configuration directives available.  Be sure
to read through this list completely before attempting to decide
what directives are appropriate for your system.  
.sp
More information on some of these options is available in the
the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR.  If you do not have a printed
copy, you should configure your system with the default
configuration file, \fBMH\fP, then generate and print a copy
of the guide (as described below).

.ti -.5i
etc: /usr/local/lib/mh
.br
The directory where pgm\-invoked programs go (see manual section 8).

.ti -.5i
mail: /usr/spool/mail
.br
The directory where the maildrops are stored.
If this pathname is absolute (i.e., begins with a \fB/\fR\0),
then the user's maildrop is a file called \fB$USER\fR in this directory.
If the pathname is not absolute,
then the user's maildrop is in the user's home directory under the given name.

.ti -.5i
mandir: /usr/man
.br
The parent directory of the manual entries.

.ti -.5i
manuals: standard
.br
Where manual entries should be installed,
relative to the directory given with \*(lqmandir\*(rq.
Either \*(lqlocal\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBmanl/\fR,
or \*(lqnew\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBmann/\fR,
or \*(lqold\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBmano/\fR,
or \*(lqstandard\*(rq to install manual entries under \fBman?/\fR,
or \*(lqbsd44\*(rq to install manual entries as \fBman?/\fIpage\fP.0\fR,
or \*(lqgen\*(rq to generate but not install them,
or \*(lqnone\*(rq to neither generate nor install them.

Any of these values may have the suffix \*(lq/cat\*(rq appended 
to it.   In that case, the manual entries will be formatted
with \*(lqnroff -man\*(rq and they will be installed in the
corresponding \*(lqcat?\*(rq directories.

For example,
to install manual entries under \fB/usr/man/u_man/man?\fR,
use \*(lqstandard\*(rq and \fB/usr/man/u_man\fR for \*(lqmandir\*(rq.
To install formatted manual entires under \fB/usr/contrib/man/cat?\fR,
use \*(lqstandard/cat\*(rq and \fB/usr/contrib/man\fR for \*(lqmandir\*(rq.
To install formatted manual entries using the BSD44 convention,
use \*(lqbsd44/cat\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
chown: /etc/chown
.br
The location of the \fIchown\fR\|(8) on your system.
If \fIchown\fR is in your search path,
just use the value of \*(lqchown\*(rq.
On SYS5 systems,
this should probably be \*(lq/bin/chown\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
cp: cp
.br
The command to copy files when installing, if not \*(lqcp\*(rq.
(Some sites use \*(lqcp\0\-p\*(rq.)

.ti -.5i
ln: ln
.br
The command to link files together in the source tree, if not \*(lqln\*(rq.
If you're using something like \fBlndir\fP to keep
your compile tree separate from your source tree,
set this to \*(lqln\0\-s\*(rq or \*(lqcp\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
remove: mv \-f
.br
How \fIMH\fR should make backup copies
of existing files when installing new files.
To simply remove the old files, use \*(lqrm\0\-f\*(rq.

.Uh "Compiler/loader"
.ti -.5i
cc: cc
.br
The name of your C compiler, if not \*(lqcc\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ccoptions: \-O
.br
Options given directly to \fIcc\fR\|(1).
The most common is \*(lq\-M\*(rq if you're running \fIMH\fR on an ALTOS.
This defaults to \*(lq\-O\*(rq.  If you define this and want to 
keep \*(lq\-O\*(rq, be sure to include it explicitly.
If you're using the \fIGNU\fP C compiler, it should
include `\-traditional'.  See \*(lqoptions:\*(rq for `\-D' options.

.ti -.5i
curses: \-lcurses\0\-ltermlib
.br
This should be the loader option required to load the \fItermcap\fR\|(3)
and \fIcurses\fR\|(3) libraries on your system.
On SYS5 systems, it probably should be just \*(lq\-lcurses\*(rq.
Some sites have reported that both \*(lq\-lcurses\*(rq and
\*(lq\-ltermlib\*(rq are necessary.

.ti -.5i
ldoptions: \-s
.br
Options given directly to \fIld\fR\|(1) (via \fIcc\fR\|) at the beginning
of the command line.
Useful for machines which require arguments to tell \fIld\fR to increase the
stack space (e.g. the Gould, which uses \*(lq\-m\08\*(rq).
Usually, \*(lq\-s\*(rq is a good choice in any event.

.ti -.5i
ldoptlibs:
.br
Options given directly to \fIld\fR\|(1) (via \fIcc\fR\|) at the end of the
command line.
The two most common are:
\*(lq\-ldbm\*(rq if you're running MMDF with the \fIdbm\fR package;
and, \*(lq\-lndir\*(rq if you are generating \fIMH\fR on a system
which does not load the new directory access mechanism by default
(e.g., 4.1BSD, SYS5).
If you don't have \fIlibndir\fR on your system,
the sources are in \fBmiscellany/libndir/\fR.

.ti -.5i
lex: lex \-nt
.br
Alternative version of \fIlex\fR.  Used in \fBzotnet/tws/\fR.

.ti -.5i
oldload: off
.br
This controls how \fIMH\fP will try to process library object files to
eliminate local symbols.
Support for the ALTOS loader if \*(lqon\*(rq.
Support for loaders not handling `\-x\0\-r' correctly if \*(lqnone\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ranlib: on
.br
Support for systems with \fIranlib\fR\|(1).
For SYSTEM 5 systems,
this should be \*(lqoff\*(rq which tells \fIMH\fR to use \fIlorder\fR and
\fItsort\fR instead.
Some SYSTEM 5 sites reported that running this isn't always sufficient.
If this is the case,
then you should edit \fBconf/makefiles/uip\fR to include
\fB\&../sbr/libmh.a\fR and \fB../zotnet/libzot.a\fR twice in the LIBES
variable.

.Uh "Message Transport System"
.ti -.5i
mts: sendmail
.br
Which message transport system to use.
Either \*(lqmmdf\*(rq to use \fIMMDF\fR as the transport system,
\*(lqmmdf2\*(rq to use \fIMMDF\-II\fR as the transport system,
\*(lqsendmail\*(rq to have \fISendMail\fR as the transport system,
\*(lqzmailer\*(rq to have \fIZMAILER\fP as the transport system,
or, \*(lqmh\*(rq to have \fIMH\fR as the transport system.

On UNIX systems supporting TCP/IP networking via sockets
you can add the suffix \*(lq/smtp\*(rq to the mts setting.
This often yields a superior interface as \fIMH\fR will post mail with the
local \fISMTP\fR server instead of interacting directly with \fIMMDF\fR or
\fISendMail\fR.
Hence, for TCP/IP UNIX systems,
the \*(lq/smtp\*(rq suffix to either \*(lqsendmail\*(rq or \*(lqmmdf2\*(rq is
the preferred MTS configuration.
The \*(lq/smtp\*(rq suffix is described in detail in the \fIAdministrator's
Guide\fR; be sure to set \*(lqservers:\*(rq as described in
\fImh\-tailor\fR\|(8) if you use this option.

.ti -.5i
mf: off
.br
Support for mail filtering on those systems in which the message transport
system isn't integrated with \fIUUCP\fR 
This option is strictly for an \fIMH\fR system using either \fIMMDF\-I\fR
as its transport system or one using \*(lqstand\-alone delivery\*(rq.

.Uh "UCI BBoards Facility"
.ti -.5i
bboards: off
.br
If \*(lqon\*(rq, include support for the UCI BBoards facility.
BBoards may be enabled with any mts setting.
If \*(lqoff\*(rq, the BBoard reading program \fIbbc\fR will not be installed.
If \*(lqnntp\*(rq,
include support for the UCI BBoards facility to read the Network News
via the NNTP.
If \*(lqpop\*(rq (formerly \*(lqpopbboards:\0on\*(rq),
include support for the UCI BBoards facility via the POP3 service;
this setting requires \*(lqpop:\0on\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
bbdelivery: off
.br
If \*(lqoff\*(rq,
the BBoards delivery agent and library files will not be installed.
If 
\*(lqon\*(rq,
and you set \*(lqbboards:\*(rq to something besides \*(lqoff\*(rq,
then 
the BBoards delivery agent and library files will be installed
in the \fIbbhome\fR directory (see below).
To read remote BBoards,
the usual configuration would have \fIbbc\fR talk to a \fIPOP3\fR or
\fINNTP\fR server.
However, it may be useful to set this to \*(lqoff\*(rq if 
you NFS mount the \fIbbhome\fR directory from another host
and want to use \fIbbc\fR to read those files directly.

.ti -.5i
bbhome: /usr/spool/bboards
.br
The home directory for the BBoards user.

.Uh "Post Office Protocol"
.ti -.5i
pop: off
.br
Support for POP service.
This allows local delivery for non\-local users
(a major win).
See \fBsupport/pop/pop.rfc\fR for more information on the POP.
This option currently works only on UNIX systems with TCP/IP sockets.
(It doesn't hurt to enable this option regardless of whether or not
you intend to use POP.)  See also \*(lqbboards: pop\*(rq to enable
reading bboards with the POP.

.ti -.5i
popdir: /usr/etc
.br
The directory where the POP daemon (\fBpopd\fP) will be installed.

.ti -.5i
APOP='\*(lq/etc/pop.auth\*(rq'
.br
This option indicates that the POP daemon will
support the non-standard \fBAPOP\fP command,
and specifies the name of \fBAPOP\fP authorization database.
The \fBAPOP\fP
command provides a challenge-based authentication system using
the \fBMD5\fP message digest algorithm.
This facility is documented in 
\fIThe Internet Message\fR (ISBN 0\-13\-092941\-7), a book by Marshall T. Rose.
.sp
This option also causes the
\fBpopauth\fP program to be installed, which
allows the administrator to manipulate the \fBAPOP\fP
authorization database.
For more details, see \fBsupport/pop/pop-more.txt\fR
and the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fP.

.ti -.5i
DPOP
.br
This option indicates that POP subscribers do not have
entries in the \fIpasswd\fR\|(5) file,
and instead have their own separate database (a win).

.ti -.5i
KPOP
.br
Support for KERBEROS with POP.
This code builds
\fIpopd\fP, \fIinc\fP and \fImsgchk\fP to support only the 
\*(lqkpop\*(rq protocol.
This code is still experimental, but is available for 
those sites wishing to test it.

.ti -.5i
MPOP
.br
This option indicates that the POP daemon will
support the non-standard
\fBXTND SCAN\fP command which provides performance
enhancements when using the POP over low-speed connections.
This option also causes an interactive POP
client program, \fBpopi\fP, to be compiled and installed.
A man page for the \fBpopi\fP program is also provided.
.sp
These extensions are described in 
\fIThe Internet Message\fR, a book by Marshall T. Rose.
For more details, see \fBsupport/pop/pop-more.txt\fR.
\fBNote:\fP this option requires \*(lqbboards: pop\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
POP2
.br
Have the POP daemon understand the older
POP2 protocol as well as the \fIMH\fP POP3 protocol \- a major win.
The POP daemon auto-magically
determines which POP protocol your client is using.
If you're enabling POP service,
there's no reason not to enable this option as well.
See also \fIPOPSERVICE\fR.

.ti -.5i
POPSERVICE
.br
The port name the \fIMH\fP POP will use.  For historical reasons,
this defaults to \*(lqpop\*(rq.
.sp
In 1987, the \fIMH\fP POP protocol
(POP version 3) was published as RFC1081 and
was assigned its own port number (110),
which differs from the original POP (version 1 and 2) port number (109).
.sp
To have \fIMH\fP POP use the new assigned port number, 
set POPSERVICE='\*(lqpop3\*(rq', and be sure that this service
name is listed in your \fB/etc/services\fP file on both POP client
and server hosts as \*(lq110/tcp\*(rq.
If you enable \fIPOP2\fP, you can safely leave \fIPOPSERVICE\fP
undefined unless you are using POP3 clients besides \fIMH\fP.

.ti -.5i
RPOP
.br
This option indicates that support for the UNIX variant of POP,
RPOP, which uses privileged sockets for authentication be enabled.
This peacefully co-exists with the standard POP.

.ti -.5i
SHADOW
.br
Indicates that the \fBpopd\fP POP server
can find encrypted passwords in the
\fB/etc/shadow\fR file (and not in the \fB/etc/passwd\fR file).
It should be used only for some (newer) SYSTEM 5 systems.
.in -.25i

The \*(lqAPOP\*(rq and \*(lqMPOP\*(rq non-standard POP
facilities are documented in
\fIThe Internet Message\fR (ISBN 0\-13\-092941\-7),
a book by Marshall T. Rose.
For more details, see \fBsupport/pop/pop-more.txt\fR.
The \*(lqAPOP\*(rq option peacefully co-exists with the standard POP.
The \*(lqMPOP\*(rq option requires \*(lqbboards: pop\*(rq.

.Uh "Shared libraries"
.ti -.5i
sharedlib: off
.br
If \*(lqsun4\*(rq,
makes libmh.a into a SunOS 4.0 (and later) shared library.
If you enable this, be sure to also use \*(lqoptions SUN40\*(rq.
If \*(lqsys5\*(rq, 
makes libmh.a into a SYS5 R4 (and later) shared library.
If you enable this, be sure to also use \*(lqoptions SVR4\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
slflags: \-pic
.br
The compiler flags to produce position independent code.

.ti -.5i
slibdir: /usr/local/lib
.br
The directory where the \fIMH\fP shared library should go.

.ne 4
.ti -.25i
Under SunOS (sun4)
.br
Since some \fIMH\fP programs are setuid, they'll only look for
the library in \*(lqtrusted\*(rq locations.  Putting the library
somewhere besides \fB/usr/lib\fP or \fB/usr/local/lib\fP is not advisable.

If you \fBmust\fP do this, be sure that you add the 
path given by \fBslibdir\fP to the compiler's library search list 
(e.g., \*(lqldoptions:\0\-L/usr/mh/lib\*(rq)
and make sure the path starts with a leading `/'.

You may need to run \fIldconfig\fP\|(8) manually whenever a new
shared object is installed on the system.
See \fIld\fR\|(1) for more information about using shared libraries.

.ti -.25i
Under Solaris 2.0 (and newer)
.br
The above instructions for SunOS apply, except you should set
the run-time library search path using `\-R' instead of `\-L'
(e.g., \*(lqldoptions: \-R/usr/mh/lib\*(rq).

.Uh "General System Dependencies"
.in -.5i
You should include the following directives 
which are appropriate for your version of UNIX.
If you don't know what an
option does, it probably doesn't apply to you.
.in +.5i

.ti -.5i
mailgroup: off
.br
If set, \fIinc\fR is made set-group-id to this group name.
Some SYS5 systems want this to be set to \*(lqmail\*(rq.
Set this if your \fB/usr/spool/mail\fP is not world-writeable.

Note that \fBslocal\fP doesn't know how to deal with this,
and will not work under these systems; just making it set-group-id
will open a security hole.
If you're using \*(lqmailgroup\*(rq,
you should remove \fBslocal\fP (and its man page) from your system.

.ti -.5i
signal: int
.br
The base type (int or void) of the function
parameter/return value of \fIsignal\fR\|(2).
The default is \fBint\fR.
Set \*(lqsignal void\*(rq on systems which use this type
(e.g., SYSTEM 5 V3.0 and later or Sun OS 4.0 and later).

.ti -.5i
sprintf: char *
.br
The return value of the \fIsprintf\fR library routine.
This defaults to \*(lqchar\0*\*(rq.  Set this to \*(lqint\*(rq if
you have an older version of SYSTEM 5 which has this routine return an
\*(lqint\*(rq type.

Use on XENIX/v7 systems.
Also, be sure to use \*(lqoptions V7\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ATTVIBUG
.br
This option causes
\fIMH\fP to return to the \*(lqWhat now?\*(rq
prompt if your initial editor is \fBvi\fP
and it exits with non-zero status.
Use on Sun OS 4.1 and other systems where the
\fB/usr/ucb/vi\fP editor was changed to
exit with its status equal to the number of pseudo-\*(lqerrors\*(rq
encountered during the edit.  This causes a problem for programs that
test the exit status of their editor and abort if the status is non-zero.
(This includes \fIMH\fP and programs like \fB/usr/etc/vipw\fP).

.ti -.5i
AUX
.br
Use with AUX systems.

.ti -.5i
BIND
.br
If you are running with the BIND code on UNIX systems
with TCP/IP sockets (e.g. 4.{2,3}BSD),
be sure to define this.

.ti -.5i
BSD41A
.br
Use on 4.1a Berkeley UNIX systems.

.ti -.5i
BSD42
.br
Use on Berkeley UNIX systems on or after 4.2BSD.

.ti -.5i
BSD43
.br
Use on 4.3 Berkeley UNIX systems.
Also, be sure to use \*(lqoptions BSD42\*(rq.
If \fIopenlog\fR\|(3) (see \*(lqman 3 syslog\*(rq)
takes three arguments instead of two,
and your \fIwrite\fR\|(1) command is set\-group\-id
to group \*(lqtty\*(rq, use this option.
If only one of these conditions is true, you lose.

.ti -.5i
BSD44
.br
Use on Berkeley UNIX systems on or after 4.4BSD.
Also, be sure to use \*(lqoptions BSD43\*(rq
and \*(lqoptions BSD42\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
DBMPWD
.br
Use this option if your \fIgetpwent\fR\|(3) routines read a 
dbm database (such as with Yellow Pages) instead of doing
a sequential read of \fB/etc/passwd\fR.
Without DBMPWD the entire passwd file is read into
memory one entry at a time for alias expansion.
This is a performance improvement when reading
a standard \fB/etc/passwd\fR file,
but is \fIvery\fR slow on systems with a dbm database.
At one site that runs
YP on a large passwd file, it showed a 6:1 performance improvement.

.ti -.5in
GCOS_HACK
.br
The so-called \*(lqgcos\*(rq field of the password file is 
used as a last resort
to find the user's full name (see \fImh-profile\fP\|(5) for details).
Enable this option
if your \fIpasswd\fP\|(5) man page notes that the `&'
character in the \*(lqgcos\*(rq field stands for the login name.

.ti -.5i
FCNTL
.br
Directs \fIMH\fP to use the \fBfcntl()\fP system call for kernel-level
locking.  If you're using a SYS5 system, you may want
this option.  (See also `FLOCK' and `LOCKF').

.ti -.5i
FLOCK
.br
Directs \fIMH\fP to use the \fBflock()\fP system call for kernel-level
locking.  If you're on a BSD42 system,
and you're not using NFS to read or write maildrops,
you should enable this option.  (See also `FCNTL' and `LOCKF').

.ti -.5i
HESIOD
.br
Support for HESIOD.  
This code was contributed, and included no documentation.

.ti -.5i
LOCKF
.br
Directs \fIMH\fP to use the \fBlockf()\fP system call for kernel-level
locking.  If you're using NFS to read or
write maildrops, you should enable this option.  (See also `FLOCK'
and `FCNTL').

.ti -.5i
locname
.br
Hard-wires the local name for the host \fIMH\fR is running on.
For example, locname='\*(lqPICKLE\*(rq'.
It's probably better to either let UNIX tell \fIMH\fR this information,
or to put the information in the host specific \fBmtstailor\fR file.

.ti -.5i
MORE
.br
Defines  the location of the \fImore\fR\|(1) program.
On ALTOS and DUAL systems, set
MORE='\*(lq/usr/bin/more\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq/usr/ucb/more\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
NDIR
.br
For non-Berkeley UNIX systems,
this \fIMH\fR will try to find the new directory access mechanism by looking
in \fB<ndir.h>\fR if this option is given.
Otherwise, \fIMH\fR will try \fB<dir.h>\fR.
If you still can't get this to work on your system,
edit \fBh/local.h\fR as appropriate.
(See also `SYS5DIR'.)

.ti -.5i
NFS
.br
Tells \fIMH\fR to hack around a problem in the NFS C library.
If you get an undefined symbol \*(lqruserpass\*(rq when compiling
\fIMH\fP, you probably need this option.  If, however, you include this
option and get an undefined symbol \*(lq\(ru\^\(ruruserpass\*(rq
when compiling, then you should omit this option.
(See also `NORUSERPASS'.)

.ti -.5i
NOIOCTLH
.br
Tells \fIMH\fR not to include the file \fB<sys/ioctl.h>\fR.
To be used on systems where this file is not present.

.ti -.5i
NORUSERPASS
.br
Tells \fIMH\fR that your system doesn't have the
\fIruserpass\fP\|(3) routine;
\fIMH\fR will include its own copy of this
routine in its library.
(See also `NFS'.)

.ti -.5i
NTOHLSWAP
.br
Tells \fIMH\fR to use the \fBntohl()\fR macro when processing
\fImsh\fR binary map files.  \fIMH\fR can use this macro on
systems with the include file \fBnetinet/in.h\fR,
to byte-swap the binary information in these map files.
If you're using the same map files on machines of different
architectures, enable this option.

.ti -.5i
RENAME
.br
Include this option if your system has a \fBrename()\fP library
call.  This is true on BSD42 and newer and some SYS5 systems.

.ti -.5i
SENDMAILBUG
.br
Causes SMTP reply code 451 (failure)
to be considered the same as code 250 (OK).
Since this might cause problems, only
enable this if you are certain that your SendMail will
return this code even when it doesn't mean to indicate a failure.

.\" .ti -.5i
.\" SMTP_ONEX
.\" .br
.\" Causes \fIMH\fP to give the \*(lqONEX\*(rq SMTP command

.ti -.5i
SOCKETS
.br
Indicates the availability of a socket interface
for TCP/IP networking that is compatible with 4.{2,3}BSD UNIX.
It is not necessary to define this when BSD42 is already defined,
but it might be useful for SYSTEM 5 or HPUX systems with TCP/IP sockets.

.ti -.5i
SUN40
.br
Use on Sun OS 4.0 (and later?) systems.  You also will need
\*(lqoptions BSD42\*(rq, \*(lqoptions BSD43\*(rq, and
\*(lqsignal void\*(rq.

If you're using Sun's brain-damaged approach to offering Domain
Name Service through NIS, be sure to include

Use on AT&T SYSTEM 5 R3 (and newer?) UNIX systems.  See also \fImailgroup\fR.

.ti -.5i
SYS5DIR
.br
Define this if your system uses \*(lqstruct dirent\*(rq
instead of \*(lqstruct direct\*(rq.
This is true of System V Release 3.0 and later.
Uses include file \fB<dirent.h>\fR
and the routines \fImkdir\fR, \fIrmdir\fR and \fIgetcwd\fR.

.ti -.5i
SVR4
.br
Use on AT&T SYSTEM 5 R4 (and newer?) UNIX systems. You should 
also include \*(lqoptions SYS5\*(rq and \*(lqoptions SYS5DIR\*(rq.
See also \fImailgroup\fR.
You will also need to include \*(lqoldload none\*(rq if your \fBld\fP

.ti -.5i
TERMINFO
.br
Define TERMINFO if you have it.
You get it automatically if you're running SYS5, and you don't get
it if you're not.  (If you're not SYS5, you probably have termcap.)

.ti -.5i
TZNAME
.br
Use time zone names from the \fItzname\fR variable, set via \fItzset\fR.
Only applicable on SYSTEM 5 systems and only effective when you have
asked for alpha\-timezones (see the ATZ option).  See also ZONEINFO.

.ti -.5i
UNISTD
.br
Include this option if your system has the file \fB<unistd.h>\fP.
If not specified, the LOCKF option will include \fB<sys/fcntl.h>\fP.

Include this option if your system has the \fIvsprintf\fP\|(3)
library routine; otherwise, \fI\(rudoprnt\fP\|(3) will be used.

.ti -.5i
WAITINT
.br
BSD42 based systems call the \fIwait\fP\|(2)
system routine with a pointer to type \fIunion wait\fP.
Include this option if you included \*(lqoptions BSD42\*(rq, but
your system calls the \fIwait\fP\|(2)
system routine with a pointer to type \fIint\fP

ATZ
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR to use alpha\-timezones whenever possible.
You should not use this option if you are on the Internet,
since it will make your host non-compliant with RFC-1123
(Requirements for Internet Hosts).

.ti -.5i
ATHENA

Makes \fIrepl\fR `\-nocc\0all' the default instead of `\-cc\0all'.
You may want to enable this if you're using \fIxmh\fR.

.ti -.5i
BANG
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR to favor `!' over `@@' in addressing.

.ti -.5i
BERK
.br
Optional for for 4.{2,3}BSD sites running SendMail.
Disables nearly all of the RFC822 address and header-parsing routines
in favor of recognizing such formats as ASCnet, and so on.
If you don't need to disable the parser for this reason,
you probably want to use \*(lqoptions DUMB\*(rq instead.

.ti -.5i

.br
If you previously ran a version of \fIMH\fR earlier than mh.4 use this option.
After a short grace period,
remove it and re-{configure,generate,install} everything.

.ti -.5i
DUMB
.br
Directs \fIMH\fR not to try and rewrite addresses to their 
\*(lqofficial\*(rq form.

.ti -.5i
FOLDPROT
.br
Defines the octal value for default folder-protection.
For example, FOLDPROT='\^\*(lq0700\*(rq\^'.
The default is \*(lq0711\*(rq.

.ti -.5i

.br
Defines the filename for alternate file name for \fIdist\fR and \fIrepl\fR.
For example, LINK='\^\*(lq\^\\\^\\\^043\*(rq\^'
to use the pound\-sign character.
The default is \*(lq@@\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
MHE
.br
Enables crude support for Brien Reid's MHE interface.
Recommended for use with the GNU Emacs mh-e package.

.ti -.5i
MHRC
.br
Enables \fIMH\fR to recognize the \fICShell\fR's `~'\-construct.
This is useful for sites that run with a ~/.mhrc for their users.

.ti -.5i
MIME
.br
Enables support for multi-media messages,
as specified in RFC 1341 \-\- a major win.
This allows you to include things like audio,
graphics, and the like, in your mail messages.
Several \fIMH\fP commands are extended to support these multi-media
messages,
and the \fImhn\fR command is provided to encode and decode
\fBMIME\fP messages.
For more details, see \fBmiscellany/multi-media/READ-ME\fP
and \fImhn\fR\|(1).

.ti -.5i
MSGID
.br
Enables \fBslocal\fP to detect and surpress duplicate messages received.
This code uses the \fB<ndbm.h>\fP library,
and requires \*(lqoptions BSD42\*(rq since
it uses the \fIflock\fP\|(2) system call for locking.
(Note that this means its database locking does not work over NFS.)
It has only been tested under SUN40.

.ti -.5i
MSGPROT

Support for the TTI \fItrusted mail agent\fR (TMA).
Although the TTI TMA is \fBnot\fR in the public domain,
the \fIMH\fR support for the TTI TMA \fBis\fR in the public domain.
You should enable this option only if you are licensed to run the TMA
software
(otherwise, you don't have the software in your \fIMH\fR source tree).

.ti -.5i
TTYD
.br
Support for TTYD.  This is no longer in wide use, and is not recommended.

.ti -.5i
UCI
.br
First, \*(lq_\*(rq and \*(lq#\*(rq are recognized as the prefixes for
scratch files.
Second, support for the UCI group\-leadership mechanism is enabled in
\fIconflict\fR.
Third, the first line of the file
file \fB$HOME/.signature\fR is used as the \fIFull Name\fR part
of your \*(lqFrom:\*(rq header.
This may conflict with the interpretation of this file by \fINews\fR.
If you're not at UCI, you probably don't want this option.

.ti -.5i
UK
.br
Directs the \fIscan\fR program to generate UK-style dates by default.

.ti -.5i
WHATNOW
.br
Enable certain \fIMH\fR commands to act differently when $mhdraft set.

.ti -.5i
YEARMOD
.br
This option makes the \fImh-format\fP \fB%(year)\fP function
always return a value less than 100.
Enable this option if you have local \fImh-format\fP\|(5) files
which cannot handle 4-digit years.
You should convert these files to use a 4-character field width,
or use the \fB%(modulo 100)\fP function to obtain a 2-digit year value.
After a short grace period,
remove `YEARMOD' and re-{configure,generate,install} everything.
.in -.25i

which isn't likely if you're reading this document!

.ti -.5i
regtest: off
.br
Set this to \*(lqon\*(rq

compilations of \fIMH\fP, and you do not want the hostname
and compile date included in \fIMH\fP binaries.  

.sp
.in -.5i
.PP
Now edit \fBconf/config/mtstailor\fR,
depending on your choice of the setting
for mts in the \fIMH\fR configuration file.
for an mts setting of \*(lqmh\*(rq,
look at the file \fBconf/tailor/mhmts\fR;
for an mts setting of \*(lqsendmail\*(rq, \*(lqsendmail/smtp\*(rq,
\*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq, or \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq,
look at the file \fBconf/tailor/sendmts\fR;
and,
for an mts setting of \*(lqmmdf\*(rq, or  \*(lqmmdf2\*(rq,
look at the file \fBconf/tailor/mmdf\fR.
.PP
Now install the configured files into the source areas.  (On SYS5
systems, or other systems where you get complaints about
\*(lq_index\*(rq and \*(lq_rindex\*(rq being undefined,
you should use \*(lqmake sys5\*(rq to compile mhconfig.)
.sp 1
.nf
% make
% ./mhconfig MH
.fi
.PP
\fBBefore proceeding\fP,
you should familiarize yourself with the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR.
To generate an \fInroff\fR version, go to the doc/ directory
and type:
.sp 1
.nf
% (cd ../doc/; make ADMIN.doc)
.fi
.sp
.PP
If you're already running \fIMH\fR at your site,
you should also read the \fImh\fR changes document \fBCHANGES\fP.
The source is in \fBpapers/changes/\fR.
.PP
After reading the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR, you may decide
to change your MH configuration.  If so, cd back to the \fBconf/\fP
directory, re-edit the files \fBMH\fP
and \fBconf/config/mtstailor\fR, and re-run \fImhconfig\fP.
.PP
You now proceed based on your choice of a transport system
(the setting for mts above).
The best interface is achieved with \*(lqsendmail\*(rq
followed by \*(lqmmdf\*(rq or (\*(lqmmdf2\*(rq),
and then \*(lqmh\*(rq (stand\-alone delivery, not recommended).
.SS SENDMAIL
If you have not enabled BBoards or POP
then no further MTS\-specific action is required on your part!

If you have enabled POP, but you 
want to let \fISendMail\fP deliver mail POP mail using its
standard delivery program \fB/bin/mail\fP,
then, again, no further MTS\-specific action is required on your part!

Otherwise,
go to the mts/sendmail/ directory.
.sp 1
.nf
% cd ../mts/sendmail/
.fi
.sp 1
This directory contains files whose definitions correspond to the
configuration of your \fISendMail\fR system.
If you have enabled BBoards or POP service,
then you will need to re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
First, in the \*(lqlocal info\*(rq section of your site's
\fISendMail\fR configuration file,
choose a free macro/class (B is used in this distribution),
and add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# BBoards support
DBbboards
CBbboards
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Second, immediately after the inclusion of the zerobase file,
in the \*(lqmachine dependent part of ruleset zero\*(rq section,
add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# resolve names for the BBoards system
R$+<@@$=B>		$#bboards$@@$2$:$1		topic@@bboards
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Be sure to use tabs when separating these fields.
Third, add the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(bboardsMH.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
after the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(localm.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
in your site's \fISendMail\fR configuration file.
Finally, you should link the file \fBmts/sendmail/bboardsMH.m4\fR into your
\fISendMail\fR cf/ directory and re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
.PP
If you have enabled POP service,
a similar procedure must be used on the POP service host,
to re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
First, in the \*(lqlocal info\*(rq section of your site's
\fISendMail\fR configuration file,
choose a free macro/class (P is used in this distribution),
and add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# POP support
DPpop
CPpop
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Second, immediately after the inclusion of the zerobase file,
in the \*(lqmachine dependent part of ruleset zero\*(rq section,
add these lines:
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
# resolve names for the POP system
R$+<@@$=P>		$#pop$@@$2$:$1			subscriber@@pop
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
Be sure to use tabs when separating these fields.
Third, add the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(popMH.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
after the line
.sp 1
.in +.5i
.nf
include(localm.m4)
.fi
.in -.5i
.sp 1
in your site's \fISendMail\fR configuration file.
Finally, you should link the file \fBmts/sendmail/popMH.m4\fR into your
\fISendMail\fR cf/ directory and re\-configure \fISendMail\fR.
.SS MMDF
If you want \fIMMDF\fR to be your transport service,
and have \fBNOT\fR specified \*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq (or \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq)
as your mts setting,
then go to the mmdf/ directory.
(If you're using \*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq or \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq
as your mts setting, then skip to the next section.)
.sp 1
.nf
% cd ../mts/mmdf/
.fi
.sp 1
This directory contains files whose definitions correspond to the
configuration of your \fIMMDF\fR system.
.PP
If you're running \fIMMDF\-I\fR,
then copy the following files from wherever you keep the \fIMMDF\fR sources
to this directory: mmdf/h/ch.h, mmdf/h/conf.h, utildir/conf_util.h,
utildir/ll_log.h, mmdf/h/mmdf.h, utildir/util.h, mmdf/mmdf_lib.a,
and utildir/util_lib.a.
.PP
If you're running \fIMMDF\-II\fR,
then copy the following files from where you keep the \fIMMDF\fR sources
to this directory: h/ch.h, h/conf.h, h/dm.h, h/ll_log.h, h/mmdf.h, h/util.h,
and lib/libmmdf.a
.PP
If you have enabled bboards,
then the directories \fBsupport/bboards/mmdfI\fR
and \fBsupport/bboards/mmdfII\fR
contain information you'll need to
put a UCI BBoards channel in your \fIMMDF\fR configuration.
Similarly, if you have enabled option \*(lqmf\*(rq and are
running \fIMMDF\-I\fR,
then the \fBzotnet/mf/mmdfI/\fR directory contains information you'll need to
put a \fIUUCP\fR channel in your \fIMMDF\-I\fR configuration.
Finally, the directory \fBsupport/pop/mmdfII\fR contains information you'll
need to put a POP channel in your \fIMMDF\-II\fR configuration.
.PP
Note that \fIMMDF\-II\fR is distributed with the BBoards channel,
although the version in the \fIMH\fR distribution might be more current,
the version in the \fIMMDF\-II\fR distribution has been tested with that
revision of \fIMMDF\fR.
.SS MMDF/SMTP
If you are using \*(lqmmdf/smtp\*(rq as your mts setting,
then no further MTS\-specific action is required on your part!
.SS MMDF2/SMTP
If you are using \*(lqmmdf2/smtp\*(rq as your mts setting,
then no further MTS\-specific action is required on your part!
.SS "STAND\-ALONE DELIVERY"
If, instead, you want \fIMH\fR to handle its own mail delivery,
then no further MTS\-specific action is required on your part!
.SH GENERATION
Go to the \fIMH\fP top-level directory and generate the system.
.sp 1
.nf
% cd ../; make
.fi
.PP
This will cause a complete generation of the \fIMH\fR system.
If all goes well, proceed with installation.
If not, complain, as there \*(lqshould be no problems\*(rq at this step.
.SH INSTALLATION
If the directories you chose for the user\-programs,
support\-programs and manuals
(\*(lqbin\*(rq, \*(lqetc\*(rq, \*(lqpopdir\*(rq, \*(lqslibdir\*(rq,
and \*(lqmandir\*(rq in the \fBconf/MH\fR file)
don't exist,
you should create them at this point.
.PP
Next, if you enabled support for the UCI BBoards facility,
then create a login
called \*(lqbboards\*(rq with the following characteristics:
home directory is \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR with mode 755
(actually, use the value for \*(lqbbhome\*(rq given in the \fIMH\fR
configuration file),
login shell is \fB/bin/csh\fR (or \fB/bin/sh\fR),
and, encrypted password field is \*(lq*\*(rq.
The \*(lqbboards\*(rq login should own the \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR
directory.
In addition to creating \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR,
also create \fB/usr/spool/bboards/etc/\fR
and \fB/usr/spool/bboards/archive/\fR.
These directories should also be owned by the \*(lqbboards\*(rq login.
.PP
If you enabled support for POP,
then on the POP service host,
create a login called \*(lqpop\*(rq with the following characteristics:
home directory is \fB/usr/spool/pop/\fR with mode 755,
login shell is \fB/bin/csh\fR,
and, encrypted password field is \*(lq*\*(rq.
If you don't have \fB/bin/csh\fR on your system (V7),
then \fB/bin/sh\fR is just fine.
The \*(lqpop\*(rq login should own the \fB/usr/spool/pop/\fR directory.
You'll also need to add a line to the \fB/etc/services\fR file and the
\fB/etc/rc.local\fR file,
see the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR  for more details.
.PP
If this is not the first time you have installed \fIMH\fR,
these files will need particular attention:

.nf
.in +.5i
.ta \w'VeryVeryBigDirectoryName  'u
\fIDirectory\fR	\fIFiles\fR
\*(lqetc/\*(rq	MailAliases, BBoardAliases, mtstailor
/usr/spool/bboards/	BBoards, \&.cshrc, \&.mh\(ruprofile
/usr/spool/bboards/etc/	*
.re
.in -.5i
.fi
.PP
The \fBMailAliases\fR, \fBBBoardAliases\fR, \fBmtstailor\fR and \fBBBoards\fR
files will \fBNOT\fP be installed over existing copies;
you will need to edit these by
hand and merge in any changes from your previous \fIMH\fR release.
The other files under \fB/usr/spool/bboards/\fR will be overwritten
if they exist.
You may wish to preserve your old versions of these before installing
\fIMH\fR.
.PP
As the super-user, and from the mh.6/ directory, install the system.
.sp 1
.nf
# make inst\-all
.fi
.sp 1
This will cause the \fIMH\fR 
processes and files to be transferred to the appropriate areas
with the appropriate attributes.
.SH TAILORING
See the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fR for information on tailoring \fIMH\fR for
the MTS, BBoards, and POP.
.SH DOCUMENTATION
In addition to this document,
the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fP,
and the \fIUser's Manual\fP,
there are several documents referenced by the user's manual which may be
useful.
The sources for all of these can be found under the \fBpapers/\fR directory.
.SH "OTHER THINGS"
Consult the directory \fBmiscellany/\fR for the sources to a number of things
which aren't part of the mainstream \fIMH\fR distribution,
but which are still quite useful.
.SH FILES
Too numerous to mention.  Really.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
make(1)
.SH BUGS
The \fImhconfig\fR program should be smarter.
.PP
There's no way to print the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fP
until after you have configured the system; it is difficult
to configure the system without the \fIAdministrator's Guide\fP.
.PP
The Makefiles should know when \fImhconfig\fR has been run and force
\*(lqmake clean\*(rq behavior.

Enable \fIMH\fR commands to read profile/context from open fd:s
without doing an open(); see mh-profile(5) for the details.

.ti -.5i
POP2
.br
Have the POP daemon understand the older
POP2 protocol as well as the \fIMH\fP POP3 protocol \- a major win.
The POP daemon auto-magically
determines which POP protocol your client is using.
If you're enabling POP service,
there's no reason not to enable this option as well.
See also \fIPOPSERVICE\fR.

.ti -.5i
POPSERVICE
.br
The port name the \fIMH\fP POP will use.  For historical reasons,
this defaults to \*(lqpop\*(rq.
In 1987, the \fIMH\fP POP protocol
(POP version 3) was published as RFC1081 and
was assigned its own port number (110),
which differs from the original POP (version 1 and 2) port number (109).
To have \fIMH\fP POP use the new assigned port number, 
set POPSERVICE='\*(lqpop3\*(rq', and be sure that this service
name is listed in your \fB/etc/services\fP file on both POP client
and server hosts as \*(lq110/tcp\*(rq.
If you enable \fIPOP2\fP, you can safely leave this undefined unless
you are using POP3 clients besides \fIMH\fP.

.ti -.5i
a734 17
RPATHS
.br
Directs \fIinc\fR to note UNIX \*(lqFrom\ \*(rq lines as Return-Path: info.

.ti -.5i
RPOP
.br
Enables the RPOP variant of POP, useful only if POP service is enabled.

.ti -.5i
SBACKUP
.br
Defines the prefix string for backup file names.
For example, SBACKUP='\*(lq\\\\043\*(rq'.
The default is \*(lq,\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
a743 8
SHADOW
.br
Indicates that the encrypted passwords can be found in the
\fB/etc/shadow\fR file (and not in the \fB/etc/passwd\fR file).
This option is used only by the \fBpopd\fP POP server. 
It should be used only for some (newer) SYSTEM 5 systems.

Although the TTI TMA is \fBnot\fR in the public domain,
the \fIMH\fR support for the TTI TMA \fBis\fR in the public domain.
You should enable this option only if you are licensed to run the TMA
software
(otherwise, you don't have the software in your \fIMH\fR source tree).

.ti -.5i
TTYD
.br
Support for TTYD.  This is no longer in wide use, and is not recommended.

.ti -.5i

(e.g., SYSTEM 5 V3.0 and later or Sun OS 4.0 and later).

UCI
.br
First, \*(lq_\*(rq and \*(lq#\*(rq are recognized as the prefixes for
scratch files.
Second, support for the UCI group\-leadership mechanism is enabled in
\fIconflict\fR.
Third, the file \fB$HOME/.signature\fR is considered to contain 
a single line of text which is used as the \fIFull Name\fR part
of your \*(lqFrom:\*(rq header.
This may conflict with the interpretation of this file by \fINews\fR.
If you're not at UCI, you probably don't want this option.

Directs the \fIscan\fR program to generate UK-style dates.

If you're running SunOS 3.5 and using their brain-damaged approach
to offering Domain Name Service through NIS,
you're going to have to enable \*(lqoptions BERK\*(rq to
prevent \fIMH \fP from trying to resolve hostnames.  
This is because the Sun NIS/DNS interface is broken when
resolving hosts which have no \*(lqA\*(rq resource records.
You could use the \fBlibresolv.a\fP libarary to work around the NIS
problems, but it's also broken under SunOS 3.5.  Sorry.

The return value of the \fIsprintf\fR library routine.
This defaults to \*(lqchar\ *\*(rq.  Set this to \*(lqint\*(rq if
you have an older version of SYSTEM 5 which has this routine return an
\*(lqint\*(rq type.

.ti -.5i
sharedlib: off
.br
Makes libmh.a into a shared library (only for SunOS 4.0 and later).  
If you enable this, be sure to use \*(lqoptions SUN40\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
slibdir: /usr/local/lib
.br
The directory where the \fIMH\fP shared library should go.

Since some \fIMH\fP programs are setuid, they'll only look for
the library in \*(lqtrusted\*(rq locations.  Putting the library
somewhere besides \fB/usr/lib\fP or \fB/usr/local/lib\fP is not advisable.

You may need to run \fIldconfig\fP\0(8) manually whenever a new
shared object is installed on the system.
See \fIld\fR\0(1) for more information about using shared libraries.

.ti -.5i
oldload: off
.br
Support for the ALTOS loader if \*(lqon\*(rq.
Support for loaders not handling `\-x\0\-r' correctly if \*(lqnone\*(rq.

.ti -.5i
ranlib: on
.br
Support for systems with \fIranlib\fR\0(1).
For SYSTEM 5 systems,
this should be \*(lqoff\*(rq which tells \fIMH\fR to use \fIlorder\fR and
\fItsort\fR instead.
Some SYSTEM 5 sites reported that running this isn't always sufficient.
If this is the case,
then you should edit \fBconf/makefiles/uip\fR to include
\fB\&../sbr/libmh.a\fR and \fB../zotnet/libzot.a\fR twice in the LIBES
variable.

.ti -.5i
tma: off
.br
Support for the TTI \fItrusted mail agent\fR (TMA).
Although the TTI TMA is \fBnot\fR in the public domain,
the \fIMH\fR support for the TTI TMA \fBis\fR in the public domain.
You should enable this option only if you are licensed to run the TMA
software
(otherwise, you don't have the software in your \fIMH\fR source tree).

.ti -.5i
regtest: off
.br
Set this to \*(lqon\*(rq
if you are doing regression testing among different
compilations of \fIMH\fP, and you do not want the hostname
and compile date included in \fIMH\fP execuatbles.

Makes a lot of simplifying assumptions that makes the code run a bit faster;
disables much of the address and header-parsing routines.
