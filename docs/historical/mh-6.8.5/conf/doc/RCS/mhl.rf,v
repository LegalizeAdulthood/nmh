\fIMhl\fR is a formatted message listing program.
It can be used as a replacement for \fImore\fR\0(1)
(the default \fIshowproc\fR\0).
As with \fImore\fR,
each of the messages specified as arguments (or the standard input) will be
output.
If more than one message file is specified,
the user will be prompted prior to each one,
and a <RETURN> or <EOT> will begin the output,
with <RETURN> clearing the screen (if appropriate),
and <EOT> (usually CTRL\-D) suppressing the screen clear.
An <INTERRUPT> (usually CTRL\-C) will abort the current message output,
prompting for the next message (if there is one),
and a <QUIT> (usually CTRL-\\) will terminate the program (without core dump).

The `\-bell' option tells \fImhl\fR to ring the terminal's bell at the end of each page,
while the `\-clear' option tells \fImhl\fR to clear the scree at the end of
each page (or output a formfeed after each message).
Both of these switches (and their inverse counterparts)
take effect only if the profile entry \fImoreproc\fR is defined but empty,
and \fImhl\fR is outputting to a terminal.
If the \fImoreproc\fR entry is defined and non-empty,
and \fImhl\fR is outputting to a terminal,
then \fImhl\fR will cause the \fImoreproc\fR to be placed between the
terminal and \fImhl\fR and the switches are ignored.
Furthermore,
if the `\-clear' switch is used and \fImhl's\fR output is directed to a
terminal,
then \fImhl\fR will consult the \fB$TERM\fR and \fB$TERMCAP\fR
envariables to determine the user's
terminal type in order to find out how to clear the screen.
If the `\-clear' switch is used and \fImhl's\fR output is not directed to
a terminal (e.g., a pipe or a file),
then \fImhl\fR will send a formfeed after each message.

To override the default \fImoreproc\fR and the profile entry,
use the `\-moreproc\ program' switch.
Note that \fImhl\fR will never start a \fImoreproc\fR if invoked on a
hardcopy terminal.

The `\-length\ length' and `\-width\ width' switches set the screen length and
width, respectively.
These default to the values indicated by \fB$TERMCAP\fR,
if appropriate,
otherwise they default to 40 and 80, respectively.

The default format file used by \fImhl\fR is called \fImhl.format\fR
(which is first searched for in the user's \fIMH\fR directory,
and then sought in the \fI@@(MHETCPATH)\fR directory),
this can be changed by using the `\-form\ formatfile' switch.

Finally,
the `\-folder\ +folder' switch sets the \fIMH\fR folder name,
which is used for the \*(lqmessagename:\*(rq field described below.
The envariable \fB$mhfolder\fR is consulted for the default value,
which \fIshow\fR, \fInext\fR, and \fIprev\fR initialize appropriately.

\fIMhl\fR operates in two phases:
1) read and parse the format file,
and 2) process each message (file).
During phase 1,
an internal description of the format is produced as a structured list.
In phase 2,
this list is walked for each message,
outputting message information under the format constraints from the format
file.

The \*(lqmhl.format\*(rq form file contains information controlling
screen clearing, screen size, wrap\-around control, transparent text,
component ordering, and component formatting.
Also, a list of components to ignore may be specified,
and a couple of \*(lqspecial\*(rq components are defined to provide added
functionality.
Message output will be in the order specified by the order in the format file.

Each line of mhl.format has one of the formats:

     ;comment
     :cleartext
     variable[,variable...]
     component:[variable,...]

A line beginning with a `;' is a comment, and is ignored.
A line beginning with a `:' is clear text,
and is output exactly as is.
A line containing only a `:' produces a blank line in the output.
A line beginning with \*(lqcomponent:\*(rq defines the format for the specified
component,
and finally, remaining lines define the global environment.

For example, the line:

.ti +.5i
width=80,length=40,clearscreen,overflowtext="***",overflowoffset=5

defines the screen size to be 80 columns by 40 rows,
specifies that the screen should be cleared prior to each page,
that the overflow indentation is 5,
and that overflow text should be flagged with \*(lq***\*(rq.

Following are all of the current variables and their arguments.
If they follow a component,
they apply only to that component,
otherwise, their affect is global.
Since the whole format is parsed before any output processing,
the last global switch setting for a variable applies to the whole message
if that variable is used in a global context
(i.e., bell, clearscreen, width, length).

To specify the value of integer\-valued and string\-valued variables,
follow their name with an equals\-sign and the value.
Integer\-valued variables are given decimal values,
while string\-valued variables are given arbitrary text bracketed by
double\-quotes.
If a value is suffixed by \*(lq/G\*(rq or \*(lq/L\*(rq,
then its value is useful in a global\-only or local\-only context
(respectively).

A line of the form:

    ignores=component,...

specifies a list of components which are never output.

The component \*(lqMessageName\*(rq (case\-insensitive)
will output the actual message name (file name) preceded by
the folder name if one is specified or found in the environment.
The format is identical to that produced by the `\-header' option to
\fIshow\fR.

The component \*(lqExtras\*(rq will output all of the components of the message
which were not matched by explicit components,
or included in the ignore list.
If this component is not specified,
an ignore list is not needed since all non\-specified components will be
ignored.

If \*(lqnocomponent\*(rq is NOT specified, then the component name will be
output as it appears in the format file.

The default format is:

.nf
.in +.5i
.ne 15
.eo
.so @@(MHETCPATH)/mhl.format
.ec
.in -.5i
.fi

The variable \*(lqformatfield\*(rq specifies a format string
(see \fImh\-format\fR\0(5)).
The flag variables \*(lqaddrfield\*(rq and \*(lqdatefield\*(rq
(which are mutually exclusive),
tell \fImhl\fR to interpret the escapes in the format string
as either addresses or dates, respectively.

By default,
\fImhl\fR does not apply any formatting string to fields containing address or
dates (see \fImh\-mail\fR\0(5) for a list of these fields).
Note that this results in faster operation
since \fImhl\fR must parse both addresses and dates in order to apply a
format string to them.
If desired,
\fImhl\fR can be given a default format string for either address or date
fields (but not both).
To do this,
on a global line specify: either the flag addrfield or datefield,
along with the apropriate formatfield variable string.

There should be some way to pass `bell' and `clear' information to the 
front\-end.

On hosts where \fIMH\fR was configured with the BERK option,
address parsing is not enabled.

The \*(lqnonewline\*(rq option interacts badly 
with \*(lqcompress\*(rq and \*(lqsplit\*(rq.
