\fIRcvstore\fR incorporates a message from the standard input
into an \fIMH\fR folder.
If `+folder' isn't specified,
a folder in the user's \fIMH\fR directory will be used, either that
specified by the \*(lqInbox:\*(rq entry in the user's profile, or
the folder named \*(lqinbox\*(rq.
The new message being incorporated is assigned the next highest
number in the folder.
If the specified (or default) folder doesn't exist,
then it will be created if the `\-create' option is specified,
otherwise \fIrcvstore\fP will exit.

If the user's profile contains a \*(lqMsg\-Protect: nnn\*(rq entry, it
will be used as the protection on the newly created messages,
otherwise the \fIMH\fR default of 0644 will be used.
During all operations on messages,
this initially assigned protection will
be preserved for each message, so \fIchmod\fR(1) may be used to set a
protection on an individual message, and its protection will be
preserved thereafter.

\fIRcvstore\fR will incorporate anything except zero length messages
into the user's MH folder.

If the profile entry \*(lqUnseen\-Sequence\*(rq is present and non\-empty,
then \fIrcvstore\fR will add the newly incorporated message to each
sequence named by the profile entry.
This is similar to the \*(lqPrevious\-Sequence\*(rq profile entry supported
by all \fIMH\fR commands which take `msgs' or `msg' arguments.
Note that \fIrcvstore\fR will not zero each sequence prior to adding messages.

Furthermore,
the incoming messages may be added to user-defined sequences as
they arrive by appropriate use of the `\-sequence' option.
As with \fIpick\fP,
use of the `\-zero' and `\-nozero' switches can also be used to zero
old sequences or not.
Similarly,
use of the `\-public' and `\-nopublic switches
may be used to force additions to public and private sequences.

No context changes will be attempted,

.Bu
If you use the \*(lqUnseen\-Sequence\*(rq profile entry,
\fIrcvstore\fP could try to update the context while another
\fIMH\fP process is also trying to do so.
This can cause the context to become corrupted.
To avoid this, do not use \fIrcvstore\fP
if you use the \*(lqUnseen\-Sequence\*(rq profile entry.
