\fIRefile\fR moves (\fImv\fR\0(1)) or links (\fIln\fR\0(1)) messages from a
source folder into one or more destination folders.
If you think
of a message as a sheet of paper, this operation is not
unlike filing the sheet of paper (or copies) in file cabinet
folders.
When a message is filed, it is linked into the
destination folder(s) if possible, and is copied otherwise.
As long
as the destination folders are all on the same file system, multiple filing
causes little storage overhead.
This facility provides a good way to cross\-file or multiply\-index
messages.
For example, if a message is received from Jones about
the ARPA Map Project, the command

     refile\0cur\0+jones\0+Map

would allow the message to be found in either of the two
folders `jones' or `Map'.

The option `\-file\ file' directs \fIrefile\fR to use the specified
file as the source message to be filed, rather than a message from
a folder.
Note that the file should be a validly formatted message,
just like any other \fIMH\fR message.
It should \fBNOT\fR be in mail drop format
(to convert a file in mail drop format to a folder of \fIMH\fR messages,
see \fIinc\fR\0(1)).

If a destination folder doesn't exist, \fIrefile\fR will ask if you
want to create it.
A negative response will abort the file operation.
If the standard input for \fIrefile\fR is \fInot\fR a tty,
then \fIrefile\fR will not ask any questions and will proceed as if
the user answered \*(lqyes\*(rq to all questions.

The option `\-link' preserves the source folder copy of the message
(i.e., it does a \fIln\fR(1) rather than a \fImv\fR(1)), whereas,
`\-nolink' deletes the filed messages from the source
folder.
Normally, when a message is filed, it is assigned the
next highest number available in each of the destination folders.
Use of the `\-preserve' switch will override this message
renaming, but name conflicts may occur, so
use this switch cautiously.

If `\-link' is not specified (or `\-nolink' is specified),
the filed messages will be removed from the
source folder, by renaming them with a site-dependent prefix (usually 
a comma).

.ne 4
If the user has a profile component such as

	rmmproc:	/bin/rm

then \fIrefile\fR
will instead call the named program to delete the message files.
The user may specify `\-rmmproc program' on the command line
to override this profile specification.
The \`-normmproc' option forces 
the message files to be deleted
by renaming them as described above.

The `\-draft' switch tells \fIrefile\fR to file the <mh\-dir>/draft.

`\-nopreserve'
.Co
If `\-src\ +folder' is given, it will become the
current folder.
If neither `\-link' nor `all' is specified,
the current message in the source
folder will be set to the last message specified; otherwise, the
current message won't be changed.

If the Previous\-Sequence profile entry is set,
in addition to defining the named sequences from the source folder,
\fIrefile\fR will also define those sequences for the destination folders.
See \fImh\-sequence\fR\0(5) for information concerning the previous sequence.
.Bu
Since \fIrefile\fR uses your \fIrmmproc\fP to delete the message,
the \fIrmmproc\fP must \fBNOT\fP call \fIrefile\fP without 
specifying `\-normmproc',
or you will create an infinte loop.
