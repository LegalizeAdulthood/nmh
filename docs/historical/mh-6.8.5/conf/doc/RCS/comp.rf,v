\fIComp\fR is used to create a new message to be mailed.
It copies a message form to
the draft being composed and then invokes an editor on the draft
(unless `\-noedit' is given, in which case the initial edit is suppressed).

The default message form contains the following elements:

.nf
.in +.5i
.ne 10
.eo
.so @@(MHETCPATH)/components
.ec
.in -.5i
.fi

If the file named \*(lqcomponents\*(rq exists in the user's MH directory,
it will be used instead of this form.
The file specified by `\-form\ formfile' will be used if given.
You may also start \fIcomp\fR using the contents of an existing
message as the form.
If you supply either a `+folder' or `msg' argument, that message will be used
as the form.  You may not supply both a `\-form\ formfile' and a `+folder' or
\&`msg' argument.
The line of dashes
or a blank line must be left between the header and the
body of the message for the message to be identified properly when it is
sent (see \fIsend\fR\0(1)).
The switch `\-use' directs \fIcomp\fR to
continue editing an already started message.
That is, if a
\fIcomp\fR (or \fIdist\fR, \fIrepl\fR, or \fIforw\fR\0) is terminated without
sending the draft, the draft can be edited again via
\*(lqcomp\ \-use\*(rq.

If the draft already exists, \fIcomp\fR will ask
you as to the disposition of the draft.
A reply of \fBquit\fR will abort \fIcomp\fR, leaving the draft intact;
\fBreplace\fR will replace the existing draft with the appropriate form;
\fBlist\fR will display the draft;
\fBuse\fR will use the draft for further composition;
and \fBrefile\ +folder\fR will
file the draft in the given folder, and give you a new draft with the
appropriate form.
(The `+folder' argument to \fBrefile\fR is required.)

The `\-draftfolder\ +folder' and `\-draftmessage\ msg' switches invoke the
\fIMH\fR draft folder facility.
This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult the \fBAdvanced Features\fR section of the \fIMH\fR manual for more
information.

The `\-file\ file' switch says to use the named file as the message draft.

The `\-editor\ editor' switch indicates the editor to
use for the initial edit.
Upon exiting from the editor,
\fIcomp\fR will invoke the \fIwhatnow\fR program.
See \fIwhatnow\fR\0(1) for a discussion of available options.
The invocation of this program can be inhibited by using the `\-nowhatnowproc'
switch.
(In truth of fact,
it is the \fIwhatnow\fR program which starts the initial edit.
Hence, `\-nowhatnowproc' will prevent any edit from occurring.)

If \fIwhatnowproc\fR is \fIwhatnow\fR,
then \fIcomp\fR uses a built\-in \fIwhatnow\fR,
it does not actually run the \fIwhatnow\fR program.
Hence, if you define your own \fIwhatnowproc\fR,
don't call it \fIwhatnow\fR since \fIcomp\fR won't run it.
