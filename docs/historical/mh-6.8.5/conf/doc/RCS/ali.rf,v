\fIAli\fR
searches the named mail alias files for each of the given \fIaliases\fR.
It creates a list of addresses for those \fIaliases\fR,
and writes that list on standard output.
If the `\-list' option is specified, each address appears on a separate line;
otherwise, the addresses are separated by commas and printed on
as few lines as possible.

The `\-user' option directs \fIali\fR to perform its processing in an
inverted fashion:
instead of listing the addresses that each given alias expands to,
\fIali\fR will list the aliases that expand to each given address.
If the `\-normalize' switch is given,
\fIali\fR will try to track down the official hostname of the address.

The files specified by the profile entry \*(lqAliasfile:\*(rq and any
additional alias files given by the `\-alias aliasfile' switch will be read.
Each \fIalias\fR is processed as described in \fImh\-alias\fR\0(5).

The `\-user' option with `\-nonormalize' is not entirely accurate,
as it does not replace local nicknames for hosts with their official
site names.
