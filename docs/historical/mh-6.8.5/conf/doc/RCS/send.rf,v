\fISend\fR will cause each of the specified files to
be delivered (via \fIpost\fR\0(8)) to each of the destinations
in the \*(lqTo:\*(rq, \*(lqcc:\*(rq, \*(lqBcc:\*(rq, and \*(lqFcc:\*(rq
fields of the message.
If \fIsend\fR is re\-distributing a message, as invoked from \fIdist\fR,
then the corresponding \*(lqResent\-xxx\*(rq fields are examined
instead.

If `\-push' is specified,
\fIsend\fR will detach itself from the user's terminal and perform its
actions in the background.
If \fIpush\fR\0'd and the draft can't be sent,
then the `\-forward' switch says that draft should be forwarded with
the failure notice sent to the user.
This differs from putting \fIsend\fR in the background because the output is
trapped and analyzed by \fIMH\fR.

If `\-verbose' is specified, \fIsend\fR will indicate the interactions
occurring with the transport system, prior to actual delivery.
If `\-watch' is specified \fIsend\fR will monitor the delivery of local and
network mail.  Hence, by specifying both switches, a large detail of 
information can be gathered about each step of the message's entry into the
transport system.

The `\-draftfolder\ +folder' and `\-draftmessage\ msg' switches invoke the
\fIMH\fR draft folder facility.
This is an advanced (and highly useful) feature.
Consult the \fBAdvanced Features\fR section of the \fIMH\fR manual for more
information.
@@BEGIN: MIME

If `\-split' is specified,
\fIsend\fR will split the draft into one or more partial messages
prior to sending.
This makes use of the multi-media content feature in MH.
Note however that if \fIsend\fR is invoked under \fIdist\fR\0(1),
then this switch is ignored\0--\0it makes no sense to redistribute a
message in this fashion.
Sometimes you want \fIsend\fR to pause after posting a partial message.
This is usually the case when you are running \fIsendmail\fR and
expect to generate a lot of partial messages.
The argument to `\-split' tells it how long to pause between postings.
@@END: MIME

\fISend\fR with no \fIfile\fR
argument will query whether the draft is the intended file, whereas
`\-draft' will suppress this question.
Once the transport system has successfully accepted custody of the message,
the file will be renamed
with a leading comma, which allows it to be retrieved until the
next draft message is sent.
If there are errors in the
formatting of the message, \fIsend\fR will abort with a (hopefully)
helpful error message.

If a \*(lqBcc:\*(rq field is encountered,
its addresses will be used for delivery,
and the \*(lqBcc:\*(rq field will be removed from the message sent to sighted
recipients.
The blind recipients will receive an entirely new message with
a minimal set of headers.
Included in the body of the message will be a copy of the message sent to the
sighted recipients.
If `\-filter\ filterfile' is specified,
then this copy is filtered (re\-formatted)
prior to being sent to the blind recipients.
@@BEGIN: MIME
Otherwise,
to use the MIME rules for encapsulation,
specify the `-mime' switch.
@@END: MIME

Prior to sending the message, the fields \*(lqFrom:\ user@@local\*(rq, and
\*(lqDate:\ now\*(rq will be appended to the headers in the message.
If the envariable \fB$SIGNATURE\fR is set,
then its value is used as your personal name when
constructing the \*(lqFrom:\*(rq line of the message.
If this envariable is not set,
then \fIsend\fR will consult the profile entry \*(lqSignature\*(rq
for this information.
On hosts where \fIMH\fR was configured with the UCI option,
if \fB$SIGNATURE\fR is not set and the \*(lqSignature\*(rq profile entry
is not present,
then the file \fB$HOME\fR/.signature is consulted.
If `\-msgid' is
specified, then a \*(lqMessage\-ID:\*(rq field will also be added to the
message.

If \fIsend\fR is re\-distributing a message
(when invoked by \fIdist\fR\0),
then \*(lqResent\-\*(rq will be prepended to each of these fields:
\*(lqFrom:\*(rq, \*(lqDate:\*(rq, and \*(lqMessage\-ID:\*(rq.
If the message already contains a \*(lqFrom:\*(rq field, then a
\*(lqSender: user@@local\*(rq field will be added as well.
(An already existing
\*(lqSender:\*(rq field is an error!)

By using the `\-format' switch,
each of the entries in
the \*(lqTo:\*(rq and \*(lqcc:\*(rq fields will be replaced
with \*(lqstandard\*(rq format entries.
This standard format is designed to be usable by all
of the message handlers on the various systems around the
Internet.
If `\-noformat' is given,
then headers are output exactly as they appear in the message draft.

If an \*(lqFcc:\ folder\*(rq is encountered, the message will be copied
to the specified folder for the sender in the format in which it will appear
to any non\-Bcc receivers of the message.
That is, it will have the appended
fields and field reformatting.
The \*(lqFcc:\*(rq fields will be removed from all outgoing copies of the
message.

By using the `\-width\ columns' switch, the user can direct \fIsend\fR as to
how long it should make header lines containing addresses.

The files specified by the profile entry \*(lqAliasfile:\*(rq and any
additional alias files given by the `\-alias aliasfile' switch will be read
(more than one file, each  preceeded by `\-alias', can be named).
See \fImh\-alias\fR\0(5) for more information.
