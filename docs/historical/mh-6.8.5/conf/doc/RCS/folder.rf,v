.ti .5i
folders
.DE
Since the \fIMH\fR environment is the shell, it is easy to lose
track of the current folder from day to day.
When \fIfolder\fR is given the `\-print' switch (the default),
\fIfolder\fR will
list the current folder, the number of messages in it, the
range of the messages (low\-high), and the current message within
the folder, and will flag extra files if they exist.
An example of this summary is:

.nf
.if t .in +.5i
.ta \w'/rnd/phyl/Mail/EP 'u +\w'has ddd messages 'u +\w'(ddd\-ddd); 'u
inbox+	has \016 messages	(\0\03\-\022);	cur=\0\05.
.re
.if t .in -.5i
.fi

If a `+folder' and/or `msg' are specified, they will
become the current folder and/or message.
By comparison,
when a `+folder' argument is given,
this corresponds to a \*(lqcd\*(rq operation in the \fIshell\fR;
when no `+folder' argument is given,
this corresponds roughly to a \*(lqpwd\*(rq operation in the \fIshell\fR.

If the specified (or default) folder doesn't exist,
the default action is to query the user
as to whether the folder should be created;
when standard input is not a tty, the answer to 
the query is assumed to be \*(lqyes\*(rq.

Specifying `\-create' will cause \fIfolder\fP to create
new folders without any query.
(This is the easy way to create an empty folder for use later.)
Specifying `\-nocreate' will 
cause \fIfolder\fP to exit without creating a non-existant folder.
.\"
.\" note - this doesn't work at present
.\" If `\-noprint' is specified, 
.\" a `+folder' and/or `msg' may still be specified
.\" to set the current folder and/or message,
.\" but the folder summary will not be printed.
.Uh "Multiple Folders"
Specifying `\-all'
will produce a summary line for each top-level
folder in the user's MH directory, sorted alphabetically.
(If \fIfolder\fR
is invoked by a name ending with \*(lqs\*(rq (e.g., \fIfolders\fR\0),
`\-all' is assumed).
Specifying `\-recurse' with `\-all' will also 
produce a line for all sub-folders.
These folders are all preceded by the read\-only folders,
which occur as \*(lqatr\-cur\-\*(rq entries in the user's \fIMH\fR context.
For example,

.ne 9
.nf
.if t .in +.5i
.ta \w'/rnd/phyl/Mail/EP 'u +\w'has ddd messages 'u +\w'(ddd\-ddd); 'u
Folder	\0\0\0# of messages	(\0range\0)	cur msg (other files)
/fsd/rs/m/tacc	has \035 messages	(\0\01\-\035);	cur=\023.
/rnd/phyl/Mail/EP	has \082 messages	(\0\01\-108);	cur=\082.
ff	has \0no messages.
inbox+	has \016 messages	(\0\03\-\022);	cur=\0\05.
mh	has \076 messages	(\0\01\-\076);	cur=\070.
notes	has \0\02 messages	(\0\01\-\0\02);	cur=\0\01.
ucom	has 124 messages	(\0\01\-124);	cur=\0\06; (others).
.ta \w'/rnd/phyl/Mail/EP has 'u
\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0TOTAL=	339 messages in 7 folders
.re
.if t .in -.5i
.fi

The \*(lq+\*(rq after inbox indicates that it is the current folder.
The \*(lq(others)\*(rq indicates that the folder `ucom' has files
which aren't messages.
These files may either be sub\-folders,
or files that don't belong under the MH file naming scheme.

The header is output if either a `\-all' or a `\-header' switch
is specified; it is suppressed by `\-noheader'.
A `\-total' switch will produce only the
summary line.

If `\-fast' is given, only the folder name (or names in the
case of `\-all') will be listed.
(This is faster because the
folders need not be read.)

If a `+folder' 
is given along with the `\-all' switch,
\fIfolder\fR will,
in addition to setting the current folder,
list the top\-level folders for the current folder (with `\-norecurse')
or list all sub-folders under the current folder recursively (with `\-recurse').
In this case, if a `msg' is also supplied,
it will become the current message of `+folder'.

The `\-recurse' switch lists each folder recursively, so
use of this option effectively defeats the speed enhancement of the `\-fast'
option,
since each folder must be searched for subfolders.
Nevertheless, the combination of these options is useful.

.Uh "Compacting a Folder"
The `\-pack' switch will compress the message names in the
designated folders, removing holes in message numbering.
The `\-verbose' switch directs \fIfolder\fR to tell the user the general
actions that it is taking to compress the folder.

.Uh "The Folder Stack"
The `\-push' switch directs \fIfolder\fR to push the current folder onto the
\fIfolder\-stack\fR,
and make the `+folder' argument the current folder.
If `+folder' is not given,
the current folder and the top of the \fIfolder\-stack\fR are exchanged.
This corresponds to the \*(lqpushd\*(rq operation in the \fICShell\fR.

The `\-pop' switch directs \fIfolder\fR to discard the top of the
\fIfolder\-stack\fR,
after setting the current folder to that value.
No `+folder' argument is allowed.
This corresponds to the \*(lqpopd\*(rq operation in the \fICShell\fR.
The `\-push' switch and the `\-pop' switch are mutually exclusive:
the last occurrence of either one overrides any previous occurrence of the
other.  Both of these switches also set `\-list' by default.

The `\-list' switch directs \fIfolder\fR to list the contents of the
\fIfolder\-stack\fR.
No `+folder' argument is allowed.
After a successful `\-push' or `\-pop', the `\-list' action is taken,
unless a `\-nolist' switch follows them on the command line.
This corresponds to the \*(lqdirs\*(rq operation in the \fICShell\fR.
The `\-push', `\-pop', and `\-list' switches turn
off `\-print'.

.Hi
In previous versions of \fIMH\fR,
the `\-fast' switch prevented context changes from
occurring for the current folder.
This is no longer the case: if `+folder' is given,
then \fIfolder\fR will always change the current folder to that.
