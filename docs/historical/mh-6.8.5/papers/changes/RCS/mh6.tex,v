This document (version \versiontag/)
was \LaTeX set \today\ with \fmtname\ v\fmtversion.}

\begin{abstract}
This document describes the user-visible and internal changes to the
UCI version of the Rand \MH/ system from \MH/~\#6.5
to \MH/.6.7.  The first part should be of interest to all users
of \MH/, while the latter part is of interest only to \MH/
Administrators.

This document is meant to supplement,
not supersede, the standard \MH/ User's manual\cite{MH.USR} and
\MH/ Administrator's manual\cite{MH.ADM}.

Comments concerning this documentation should be addressed to the Internet
mailbox {\sf Bug-MH@@ICS.UCI.EDU}.
\end{abstract}

\newpage
\section* {Acknowledgements}
The \MH/ system described herein is based on the original Rand \MH/ system.
It has been extensively developed (perhaps too much so) by Marshall T.~Rose
and John L.~Romine at the University of California, Irvine.

For this release, numerous \MH/-Workers sent in fixes and other
changes.  Also, a number of sites served as beta-testers for
the changes which were made.
\section* {Disclaimer}
The Regents of the University of California wish to make it known that:
\begin{quote}
Although each program has been tested by its contributor,
no warranty, express or implied,
is made by the contributor or the University of California,
as to the accuracy and functioning of the program
and related program material,
nor shall the fact of distribution constitute any such warranty,
and no responsibility is assumed by the contributor
or the University of California in connection herewith.
\end{quote}

\section* {Conventions}
In this document,
certain \LaTeX -formatting conventions are adhered to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The names of \unix/ commands, such as \pgm{comp},
are presented in {\it text italics}.

\item Arguments to programs, such as \arg"msgs",
are presented in {\tt typewriter style} and delimited by single-quotes.

\item \unix/ pathnames and envariables,
such as $$\file{/usr/uci/}\hbox{\qquad and\qquad}\file{\$SIGNATURE},$$
are presented in {\sl slanted roman}.

\item Text presenting an example, such as
\begin{verbatim}
    comp -editor zz
\end{verbatim}
is presented in {\tt typewriter style}.
\end{enumerate}

\newpage
\section* {General Changes}
The author is pleased to announce that there are very few
user-visible
changes to \MH/.6.7 from the previous \MH/.6.6 distribution.
The majority of development was in the form of bug fixes and 
slight enhancements.
In addition, this release is slightly faster than the
previous release.
With a few minor exceptions, 
it is backward-compatible with the previous release.

The changes were made mainly to generalize the source code to
be compatible with a larger range of systems and compilers.
There were many small changes to add declarations for ANSI C compliance.
The System 5 support has been brought up to SYS5 R3, and there is
support for Sun OS 4.0.

\subsection*{Using Aliases}
A new profile entry \arg"Aliasfile:" has been added.  The
\pgm{ali}, \pgm{send}, and \pgm{whom} programs will look for
this profile entry and treat it as they would an argument to
\switch"alias".
This should make it easier for novice \MH/ users to begin
using aliases.

\subsection*{BBoards \& News}
In addition to reading local BBoards, 
the UCI BBoards facility\cite{MH.BB}
has been augmented to let it read the Network
News using the NNTP\cite{NetworkNews}
instead of reading remote BBoards with the 
POP\cite{MH.POP}\cite{MH.XPOP}.
This capability is enabled by compiling \MH/ with
the \arg"bboards: nntp" option.
Unfortunately, reading remote BBoards via the POP and the Network
News via the NNTP may not both be enabled.

To support the NNTP,
a new module, \file{uip/pshsbr.c}, is compiled and loaded into
\pgm{bbc} and \pgm{msh} instead of \file {uip/popsbr.c}.
The default BBoard is changed from \arg"system" to \arg"general"
for the NNTP.

When reading BBoards,
\pgm{bbc} will first look for local BBoards, and then contact the
NNTP server to read the Network News.  The location of the
NNTP server should be specified with the \arg"nntphost:"
entry in the \file{mtstailor} file
(see the \MH/ Administrator's Guide for details),
or may be specified on
the command line with the \switch"host" switch.

\subsection*{Format Strings}
The manual page documenting format strings \man{mh-format}(5) has
been rewritten to better explain how to write format strings,
and how they are interpreted by \MH/.
A description of the \file{replcomps}
default format is now included in that manual page.

Some new format functions were added, and others were augmented:
\begin{display}{date2local}
\item [trim]
	Strips leading and trailing spaces from \verb"str".
\item [date2local]
	Will coerce the date to the local timezone.
\item [date2gmt]
	Will coerce the date to GMT.
\item [divide]
	Divides \arg"num" by its argument.  This is useful for
	building \pgm{scan} format strings which print large
	message sizes in \verb"Kb" or \verb"Mb".
\item [friendly]
	Modified to just return the text of the address header,
	if the address cannot be parsed.
\item [szone]
	A flag indicating whether the timezone was explict
	in the date string.
\end{display}
%
\section*{New Program Features}
In addition to the general changes mentioned above,
many programs have specific new features added,
either by new switches or by expanded functionality.
Each command's manual page gives complete information about 
its new options.  Here is a short summary.
\subsection*{User Interface Programs}
\def\displaylabel#1{\pgm{#1}\ \hfill}
\begin{display}{prompter}
\item [anno]
	Accepts a \switch"nodate" switch which inhibits the date annotation, 
	leaving only the body annotation.
\item [folder]
	When invoked with the \switch"pack" switch
	and the new \switch"verbose" switch, \pgm{folder} will
	give information about the actions taken to renumber the folder.

	On most systems, \pgm{folder} can now create any non-existing
	parent folders of a new sub-folder.
\item [forw]
	When making digests, \pgm{forw}
	will put the issue and volume numbers
	in the digest trailer as well as the digest list name.
\item [inc]
	Detects NFS write failures, and will
	not zero your maildrop in that event.
\item [msh]
	Supports a variant of the new \pgm{sortm}.
\item [prompter]
	Considers a period on a line by itself to signify end-of-file
	when the \switch"doteof" switch is specified.
\item [repl]
	The \switch"[no]format" switches
	have not been used since \mh5 and have been deleted.
\item [scan]
	With the \switch"file msgbox" switch, \pgm{scan}
	can list a \pgm{packf}\/'d-format file directly 
	(without using \pgm{msh}).

	Lists messages in reverse order with the \switch"reverse" switch.
	This should be considered a bug.
\item [sortm]
	Now has the options:
	\switch"textfield field", \switch"notextfield",
	\switch"limit days", and \switch"nolimit".

	With these options, \pgm{sortm} can be instructed to sort a 
	folder based on the contents of an arbitrary header such
	as \arg"subject".

	\pgm{sortm} minimizes renaming messages, and
	will no longer arbitrarily pack folders; for this behavior,
	use \verb"folder -pack".
\item [whatnow]
	Deletes the draft by renaming it with leading comma, instead
	of unlinking it.
\end{display}

\subsection*{\MH/ Support Programs}
The following support programs also have changes or enhancements:
\begin{display}{rcvtty}
\item [mhl]
	Will now accept a format string on any component, not just
	addresses and dates.
\item [popd]
	Will use {\it shadow} password files if compiled with the 
	\verb"SHADOW" option.  It can now also 
	read UUCP-style maildrops directly.
\item [rcvtty]
	If given no arguments, \pgm{rcvtty} will produce a \verb"scan"
	listing as specified by a format string or file; a default
	format string is used if one is not specified.

	Before the listing is written to the users terminal, the 
	terminal's bell is rung and a newline is output.
	The \switch"nobell" and the \switch"nonewline" options
	inhibit these functions.

	On \verb"BSD43" systems, \pgm{rcvtty} will be installed
	set-group-id to the \verb"tty" group, and will obey the
	\pgm{mesg} permissions on your terminal.
	Using the \switch"biff" switch will cause \pgm{rcvtty} to
	also obey the \pgm{biff} permissions on your terminal.
\item [slocal]
	Understands UUCP-style \arg"From " lines and will write
	output files using this format if appropriate.
	Before invoking a delivery program, \pgm{slocal} will strip
	such lines unless compiled with the \verb"RPATHS" option,
	in which case it will will convert such lines into
	\arg"Return-Path:" headers.

	\pgm{slocal} has a new result code \arg"N", 
	for use in \file{.maildelivery} files.
	With this result code,
	\pgm{slocal} will 
	perform the action only if the message has not been delivered
	and the previous action succeeded.  This allows for performing
	an action only if multiple conditions are true.
\end{display}

\section*{Documentation}
Several of the older \MH/ papers have been difficult to format
because they depended on an older version of
PhDTeX\cite{PhDTeX}\cite{AmSTeX} which was
not supplied.  These papers have been updated, and some TeX
library files are supplied in \file{papers/doclib/}, so that 
these papers may be generated on any system with TeX.

Many of the manual pages have been revised to include documentation
of new command options, and some have been expanded to give more detail.
All are now slightly reformatted at installation time
to make them more compatible with programs like \pgm{makewhatis}.

\section*{\MH/ Administration}
This section describes changes in configuring, compiling and
installing \MH/.6.7 and should not
be of interest to casual \MH/ users.
The \file{READ-ME} file has been revised to
better document the configuration and compilation options which
have been included in this release.  Some compilation options
have been removed, and many new options have been added.

All \MH/ \file{Makefile}\/s have been updated to work around some 
incompatibilities introduced in newer versions of \pgm{make}.
\MH/ programs will no longer be installed with the sticky-bit 
turned on.

Reading this section not a substitute for carefully
reading the \file{READ-ME} file before attempting to compile \MH/.

\subsection*{Bug Fixes}
Some bugs were fixed which in general were not user-visible:
\def\displaylabel#1{{\tt #1}\ \hfill}
\begin{display}{dynamic memory}
\item [address parser]
	Fixed to allow use of the \arg"AT" domain, and some 
	minor bugs were fixed pertaining to address groups.
\item [date parser]
	Improved to accept more forms of illegal dates.  Military
	timezones were removed.
\item [dynamic memory]
	Many problems with the dynamic memory pool becoming corrupted
	have been fixed.
\item [locking]
	Fixed to open files for write if necessary to enable locking.
\item [nil pointers]
	All reported nil pointer problems have been fixed.
\item [replcomps]
	The \arg"In-Reply-To:" header had quotes added 
	around the date field to comply with RFC822\cite{RFC822}.
\end{display}

\subsection*{White Pages}
If \MH/ is compiled with the \verb"WP" option,
\pgm{send} recognizes an address between \arg"<<" and \arg">>" characters
such as:
\begin{verbatim}
        To: << rose -org psi >>
\end{verbatim}
to be a name meaningful to a whitepages service.  In order to expand the
name, \pgm{send} must be invoked interactively 
(i.e., not from \pgm{push}).  For each
name, \pgm{send} will invoke a command called \pgm{fred}
in a special mode asking to expand the name.

To get a copy of the white pages service, contact wpp-manager@@psi.com.
\subsection*{Configuration Options}
Some configuration options have been added or changed:
%
\begin{display}{mailgroup}
\item [cc]
	To specify an alternate C compiler.
\item [ccoptions]
	Defaults to \switch"O".
\item [bboards]
	May now be defined as \arg"on", \arg"off", \arg"pop", or \arg"nntp".
\item [bbdelivery]
	Determines whether the bboard delivery agent should be installed.
\item [lex]
	To specify an alternate version of \pgm{lex}.
\item [mailgroup]
	If defined, \pgm{inc} will be made set-group-id to this group.
\item [sharedlib]
	For \verb"SUN40" systems; if \arg"on", makes \file{libmh.a}
	into a shared library.
\item [slibdir]
	The directory where the above shared library should be installed.
\end{display}

\subsection*{Compilation Options}
For different configurations,
several \arg"-D" options to \pgm{cc} have been added or changed:
%
\begin{display}{NOIOCTLH}
\item [BSD43]
	Will make \pgm{rcvtty} set-group-id to the group \verb"tty".
\item [NETWORK]
	This option has been deleted.  See \verb"SOCKETS".
\item [NOIOCTLH]
	Tells \MH/ not to include the file \file{sys/ioctl.h}.  Use this
	if this file is not present on your system.
\item [NTOHL]
	On systems with TCP/IP networking,
	\pgm{msh} will try to use the \verb"ntohl()" macro from the
	file \file{netinet/in.h} to byte-swap the binary map files
	it writes.
\item [SENDMAILBUG]
	Some versions of \SendMail/ return a {\tt 451} (failure) reply code 
	when they don't mean to indicate failure.  This option considers
	that code to be equivalent to {\tt 250} (OK).
\item [SHADOW]
	Causes \pgm{popd} to read the file \file{/etc/shadow} for
	encrypted passwords instead of \file{/etc/passwd}.  Use this if you
	are using a newer version of SYSTEM 5 with shadow password files.
\item [SOCKETS]
	Enable this if you are on a non-BSD system with a
	socket interface for TCP/IP networking compatible with 4.2BSD UNIX.
\item [SUN40]
	Use on Suns running Sun OS 4.0 and later.
\item [SUN41]
	Use on Suns running Sun OS 4.1 and later.
\item [SYS5]
	This option has been updated to refer to SYS5 R3 and later systems.
\item [SYS5DIR]
	Use this if your system uses \verb"struct dirent" instead of
	\verb"struct direct".  This should be true for systems based
	on SYS5 R3 and later.
\item [TYPESIG]
	Defines the base type for the {\it signal} system call.  This
	defaults to \verb"int", but should be defined as \verb"void"
	if appropriate for your system.
\item [WP]
	Enables support for the White Pages service.
\end{display}

\subsection*{Installation}
\MH/ will now
explicitly set the protection mode on every file it installs.

Previously any existing file \MH/ installed would be backed up into
the source tree, and then overwritten.
Now, a few system-dependent files will not be overwritten, and your
changes will have to be merged in by hand. 
See the \file{READ-ME} file for more details.

\section* {General Changes}
d315 6
a320 2
This document describes the changes to \MH/ from
release \MH/.6.5 to the current release \MH/.6.7.
d322 2
a323 2
Fixes for null pointers, and freeing incremented malloc'd pointers are
plentiful.
d325 1
a325 2
There were many small changes to add declarations for ANSI C
compliance.
d327 3
a329 2
\subsection*{Configuration}

d331 10
d342 6
a347 11

\item [bboards: nntp/pop/on/off]

\item [bbdelivery: on/off]

\item [lex:]

\item [sharedlib: on/off]

\item [slibdir:]

d350 4
a353 2
\subsubsection*{Compiler Options}

d355 4
d360 2
a361 2
Tells \MH/ not to include the file \file"sys/ioctl.h".  Use this
if this file is not present on your system.
d363 4
a366 1
\pgm{msh} will 
d368 3

d372 3

d379 1

d381 3

\item [SYS5 changes for R3]

d385 3
a387 1

d389 3
a391 1

d394 3
a396 3
\#ifdefs for SYS5 (release 3) and hpux.  You can now define
TYPESIG to be "void" to stop compiler warnings regarding signal types
(automatically defined that way on SUN40).
d398 4
a401 2
4. The bboard program "bbl" and associated man pages are installed if
you enable "bboards", whether or not you enable "bbdelivery".
a402 42

For SYS5, you can set "mailgroup" in the MH config file to have inc be
set-gid to that group.  You can also defined SOCKET for those non-BSD
systems with sockets.

NTOHL
The bug is minor, msh can't read map files -- which would cause
a performance penalty, as well as giving irritating diagnostic
messages.  You can add "options NONTOHL" if you don't want the
ntohl() macro to be used (for binary file transportability).

\subsection*{New Features}

7. whatnowsbr reads the "Aliasfile:" profile entry for its built-in send.

5. In mh-format, %(friendly{addr}) will return the text of the header
if it can't parse the addresses.

6. Changes to uip/mshcmds.c to support a variant of the new sortm.

---> need to add these to msh?
Other minor things are "anno -[no]date", "scan -[no]reverse", "prompter
-doteof" and "forw -[no]dashmunging".  These are either now visible or
new options.  

changes to rcvtty to work with biff,

some major changes to sortm to make it sort by subject as well as date.  

1. A new sortm, which has "-textfield field" and "-limit days".  This
lets you sort by date first, then by an arbitrary text field (like
subject).  It can also sort by text field first and date second.  It's
kinda complicated; see "man sortm" for the details.

\subsection*{Documentation}

The man pages have been updated and I'll be supplying
some TeX stuff so that the MH papers can be generated on systems
without UCI's version of AmSTeX.

mh-format man page improved

However, Van Jacobson deserves a special acknowledgement for his tireless
work in improving the performance of \MH/.
Some programs have been speeded-up by a factor of 10 or 20.
All of users of \MH/, everywhere, owe a special thanks to Van.
