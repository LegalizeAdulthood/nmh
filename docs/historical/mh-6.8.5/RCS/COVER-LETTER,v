@    A new release of the UCI version of the Rand Message Handling (MH)
    system is available for distribution.  This release of MH is called 

				  MH 6.6

    There are a lot of changes between MH.6 and MH 6.6; a lot of
    performance enhancements were made, there's also a lot of support
    for distributed mail (personal mail and bulletin bboards).

    Here are the details:  

	- MH is in the public-domain
	- MH runs on a number of versions of UNIX (4.[123]BSD, V7, SYS5, and
	  related variants, e.g., HPUX) [sorry, no support for SYS3.]
	- MH runs on top of a number of mail transport systems
	  (MMDF-{I,II}, SendMail, stand-alone (with UUCP support))

    Although MH is not "supported" per se, it does have a bug-reporting
    address, Bug-MH@@ICS.UCI.EDU (ucbvax!ucivax!bug-mh).  Bug reports
    (and fixes) are welcome, by the way.  There are also two Internet
    discussion groups:  MH-Users@@ICS.UCI.EDU and MH-Workers@@ICS.UCI.EDU.
    MH-Users is bi-directionally gatewayed to USENET as comp.mail.mh.

    There are two ways to get a distribution:

    1.  If you can FTP to the ARPA Internet, use anonymous FTP to
    ics.uci.edu [128.195.1.1] and retrieve the file pub/mh-6.6.tar.Z.
    This is a tar image after being run through the compress program
    (approx 1.5MB).  This file is also available on louie.udel.edu 
    [128.175.1.3] in portal/mh-6.tar.Z.  You may also find MH.6.6 on
    various other hosts; to make sure you get the latest version and
    don't waste your time re-fixing bugs, it's best to get it from
    either ics.uci.edu or louie.udel.edu.

    2.  You can send $75 US to the address below.  This covers the cost
    of a magtape, handling, and shipping.  In addition, you'll get a
    laser-printed hard-copy of the entire MH documentation set.  Be
    sure to include your USPS address with your check.  Checks should
    be made payable to

		Regents of the University of California

    and must be drawn on U.S.  funds.  The distribution address is:  

	Computing Support Group 
	Attn: MH distribution
	Department of Information and Computer Science
	University of California, Irvine
	Irvine, CA  92717

	714/856-7554

    Sadly, if you just want the hard-copies of the documentation, you
    still have to pay the $75.00.  The tar image has the documentation
    source (the manual is in roff format, but the rest are in TeX
    format).  I'm working on getting Postscript versions of the documents.

    louie.udel.edu [10.0.0.96] and retrieve the file portal/mh-6.tar.
    This is a tar image (approx 4MB).  The file portal/mh-6.tar.C is
    the tar image after being run through the compact program (approx
    2.3MB).  The file portal/mh-6.tar.Z is the tar image after being run
    through the compress program (approx 1.5MB).

    and must be drawn on U.S.  funds.  It's also a good idea (though not
    mandatory) to send a computer mail message to "Bug-MH@@ICS.UCI.EDU" when
    you send your check via USPS to ensure minimal turn-around time.
