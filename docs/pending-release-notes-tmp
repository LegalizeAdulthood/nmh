Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

Backward incompatibilities:
-- Changed exit status of each nmh command's -version and -help
   switches from 1 to 0.


- The following environment variables were deprecated in nmh 1.5
  and are removed from this release:
    MHPOPDEBUG (use -snoop command line switch instead)
    MM_NOASK (use -nolist and -nopause command line switches instead)
    NOMHNPROC (use -nocheckmime command line switch instead)
    FACEPROC (undocumented faceproc feature to be removed)

- repl and dist currently create a link named ./@ to the message being
  replied or redistributed.  A switch, -noatfile, has been added to
  disable creation of this link.  The current default behavior can
  also be specified with -atfile.  The current default behavior is
  obsolete/deprecated:  -noatfile will become the default in the next
  nmh release.  If there are no requests to maintain -atfile, it will
  be removed in the future.
