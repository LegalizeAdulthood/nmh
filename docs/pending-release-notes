Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

- builds use OpenSSL if available.
- post now defaults to port 587 on 'smtp' message submission.
- A value of 0 for the width switch of scan(1), inc(1), ap(1), dp(1),
  fmttest(1), and mhl(1) now means as many characters as the format
  engine can produce [Bug #15274].  That amount is limited by internal
  buffers.
- If a component has trailing whitespace, e.g., body:component="> ",
  mhl now trims that whitespace off when filtering blank text lines.
- An "rtrim" flag has been added to mhl to remove any trailing
  whitespace from filtered text lines.  A corresponding "nortrim" flag
  has also been added.
- The default locations for configuration files and suppoooort binaries
  have been changed.  Configuration files now install into ${sysconfdir}/nmh,
  and support binaries are placed in ${libexecdir}/nmh.  If you are upgrading
  an existing installation you should look for old configuration files in
  ${sysconfdir} and merge any local customizations into the new files in
  ${sysconfdir}/nmh, then remove the old files.  ${libdir} will also contain
  obsolete support programs that should be removed.
- When building from source, configure will derive ${prefix} from an existing
  nmh installation if it finds one in your $PATH.
- Added getmymbox and getmyaddr mh-format(5) function escapes.
- New -changecur, -nochangecur, and -fixtype switches have been added
  to mhfixmsg(1).
- mhfixmsg now removes an extraneous trailing semicolon from header
  parameter lists.
- Added -convertargs switch to repl(1), to pass arguments to programs
  specified in the user's profile or mhn.defaults to convert message
  content.
- Added mhical(1), to display, reply to, and cancel iCalendar (RFC 5545)
  event requests.

-----------------
OBSOLETE FEATURES
-----------------

- The undocumented -queue switch to post was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was
  removed in this release.
- conflict(8) was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.
- mhtest(8) was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.
- msh(1) was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.
- Support in alias files for the the "*" address-group (everyone) was
  deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.

-------------------
DEPRECATED FEATURES
-------------------

- Support for the MHPDEBUG environment variable is deprecated and will be
  removed from a future nmh release.  Instead, use the -debug switch to pick.
- With the move of support binaries from ${libdir} to ${libexecdir}/nmh, the
  mostly undocumented 'libdir' mhparam(1) component has been replaced by a
  new 'libexecdir' component.  'libdir' will be removed in a future release.

---------
BUG FIXES
---------

- The format scanner no longer subtracts 1 from the width.  This has the
  effect of no longer counting the trailing newline in the output of
  scan(1), inc(1), and the other programs that rely on the format scanner.
