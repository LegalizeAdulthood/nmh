Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

- All nmh programs will now warn about multiple profile entries for
  the same non-null, non-comment component.  In previous versions, all
  but the first were silently ignored.
- mhmail now supports all post(8) options, or optionally can use
  send(1) with all of its options.  Its formerly undocumented -resent
  switch has been documented.  And it has new -attach, -headerfield,
  and -send/-nosend switches.
- Default to flock() locking on OpenBSD and Darwin.
- Added -directives support to mhbuild(1) to control whether or not
  mhbuild will honor MIME directives by default.  And added support
  for special #on/#off/#pop directives to control the MIME directive
  processing state.
- Added -messageid switch to send(1) and post(8).  This allows
  selection of the style to use for generated Message-ID and
  Content-ID header fields.  The default localname style is
  pid.time@localname, where time is in seconds, and matches previous
  behavior.  The random style replaces the localname with some
  (pseudo)random bytes and uses microsecond-resolution time.
- Added -clobber switch to mhstore(1) to control overwriting of
  existing files.
- Added -outfile switch to mhstore(1).
- Added -noall/-all switches to sortm(1).  sortm -noall requires
  a messages argument.
- $PAGER overrides the compiled-in default pager command.
- Added etc/scan.highlighted format file, as an example of how to
  highlight/colorize the output of scan(1).
- inc(1) now supports a -port switch to specify the port used by the
  POP server.
- pick(1) now decodes MIME-encoded header fields before searching.
- The VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables are now supported as fallbacks
  if the user does not configure an editor entry in their profile.
- The format engine (mh_format(5)) now properly accounts for multibyte
  characters when accounting for column widths.
- burst(1) now can burst MIME-formatted digests (messages that contain
  message/rfc822 parts instead of messages formatted with RFC 934).
- All proc entries (showproc, moreproc, etc) can now accept entries that
  contain spaces and shell metacharacters.  If found, such entries will
  either be space-splitted or processed by /bin/sh.
- A new program, fmttest(1) is included to help debug format files
- mhshow/mhstore now have support for RFC-2017 (access-type=url) for
  external message bodies.
- Added -retainsequences switch to refile(1).
- A new program, mhfixmsg(1), is included to rewrite MIME messages with
  various transformations.
- Added -[no]rmmproc switches to rmm(1).
- Added support for Content-Disposition header (RFC 2183) to mhstore(1)
  and mhn(1) when used with -auto.
- All nmh commands now support transactional locking for sequence files.
- There is no longer a per-folder maximum number of sequences.
- For the SMTP MTA TLS can now be negotiated at the beginning of the
  connection with the -initialtls switch.
- Messages can now be selected using a relative offset from some other
  message, or from the start or end of a sequence.  See mh-sequences(5).
- The -changecur and -nochangecur switches have been added to mhlist(1).
- mhbuild(1) can now encode 8-bit message headers using RFC-2047 encoding
  rules.
- The whatnow(1) attach feature will determine the content type of an
  attachment using a program such as file --mime-type, if available at
  configuration time.  If not, it will use mhshow-suffix- entries as
  before.  The -v switch to attach causes it to display the mhbuild
  directive that send(1) will use.
- mhbuild(1) now supports the -auto/-noauto flags (to be used by send(1)
  when invoking mhbuild automatically).
- mhbuild(1) now is automatically run by send, to insure that all outgoing
  messages have proper MIME formatting.
- A new header, "Attach", is supported by mhbuild; it is used to replace
  previous functionality (which by default used a header named
  Nmh-Attachment).

-----------------
OBSOLETE FEATURES
-----------------
- Changed exit status of each nmh command's -version and -help
  switches from 1 to 0.
- The following environment variables were deprecated in nmh 1.5
  and removed from this release:
    MHPOPDEBUG (use -snoop command line switch instead)
    MM_NOASK (use -nolist and -nopause command line switches instead)
    NOMHNPROC (use -nocheckmime command line switch instead)
    FACEPROC (undocumented faceproc feature removed)
- Changed repl and dist default to -noatfile.  The default of -atfile
  was deprecated in nmh 1.5.  If there are no requests to maintain
  -atfile, it will be removed in the future.
- The undocumented -queue switch to mhmail has been removed.
- spost(8) has been merged into post(8).  Its functionality is enabled
  by selecting the sendmail/pipe mail transport method, described in
  the mh-tailor(5) man page.  The spost -noalias, -backup/-nobackup,
  -push/-nopush, and -remove/-noremove switches are not supported by
  post.  Note that spost did not support -whom or Dcc, and neither
  does post when using sendmail/pipe.  And spost would expand blind
  aliases and send them in the message; post with sendmail/pipe
  refuses to do that.  For backward compatibility, spost has been
  replaced by a simple shell script that exec's post -mts
  sendmail/pipe.
- Support for the undocumented and deprecated --enable-nmh-debug configure
  flag has been removed.
- Support for encoding some characters designated as EBCDIC-unsafe
  via the -ebcdicsafe and -noebcdicsafe switches to mhbuild has
  been removed.
- The configure flag --with-pager has been removed; the default pager
  is now hardcoded as "more".  Users are still free to override the
  default using the PAGER environment variable or entries in .mh_profile.
- The configure flag --with-editor has been removed; the fallback editor
  if none is configured is "vi".
- The support for the undocumented NOPUBLICSEQ preprocessor definition
  to disable public sequence support has been removed.
- Support for the -normalize and -nonormalize switches to the ali(1) and
  ap(8) commands has been removed.
- "make install" no longer strips executables.  Use "make install-strip"
  instead.
- The environment variable MM_CHARSET to indicate the native character
  set is no longer supported.  The native character set will be solely
  determined by the locale settings.
- Temporary files are stored in the first non-null location of
  {MHTMPDIR environment variable, TMPDIR environment variable, MH Path}.
  They are no longer be stored in the location specified by the TMP
  environment variable.

-------------------
DEPRECATED FEATURES
-------------------
- The undocumented -queue switch to post is deprecated/obsolete
  and will be removed in the next release.  It supports the
  SMTP XQUE verb, which is obsolete according to
  http://smtpfilter.sourceforge.net/esmtp.html
- conflict(8) is deprecated and will be removed from the next release.
- mhtest(8) is deprecated and will be removed from the next release.
- msh(1) is deprecated and will be removed from the next release.
- Support in alias files for the the "*" address-group is obsolescent
  and will be removed in a future release.

---------
BUG FIXES
---------

- Replaced utilities that operate on pbm files with those that operate
  on pnm files in etc/mhn.defaults [Bug #15152].
- Removed obsolete BUGS section at end of rcvstore(1) man page [Bug #4361].
- Fixed -nocc me doesn't account for Alternate-Mailboxes [Bug #36635].
- Propagate Mail-Followup-To [Bug #5571].
- "mark -sequence cur -delete all" now works for cur as well as any
  other sequence, to allow clearing of the current message indication.
- The first alias contained in a blind list is now expanded.  The
  mh-alias(5) man page was updated to show that blind lists must not
  be terminated with, or contain, a trailing semicolon [Bug #15604].
- Fixed sendfiles(1) to always provide a From: address.  Also, updated
  its switches.
- Fixed pick(1) to properly unfold multiple-line header fields by
  removing newlines instead of replacing them with spaces [Bug #15215].
- Removed the artificial limit of 1000 messages at a time for rmmproc.
- Fixed decoding of header fields when they contain a character that
  can't be converted.
- post(8) -sasl now honours username in .netrc [Bug #23168].  whom(1),
  send(1), inc(1), and msgchk(1) also benefit from this fix.  And, nmh
  now supports specification of any valid filename in place of
  $HOME/.netrc.
- Added quoting of local part of invalid address in message being
  replied to [Bug #26780].
- Fix segmentation fauls for %(putlit) and %(zputlit) format escapes when
  the "str" register was NULL.
