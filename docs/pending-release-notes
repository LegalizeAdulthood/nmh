Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

- builds use OpenSSL if available.
- post now defaults to port 587 on 'smtp' message submission.
- A value of 0 for the width switch of scan(1), inc(1), ap(1), dp(1),
  fmttest(1), and mhl(1) now means as many characters as the format
  engine can produce [Bug #15274].  That amount is limited by internal
  buffers.
- If a component has trailing whitespace, e.g., body:component="> ",
  mhl now trims that whitespace off when filtering blank text lines.

-----------------
OBSOLETE FEATURES
-----------------

- The undocumented -queue switch to post was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was
  removed in this release.
- conflict(8) was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.
- mhtest(8) was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.
- msh(1) was deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.
- Support in alias files for the the "*" address-group (everyone) was
  deprecated in nmh 1.6, and was removed in this release.

-------------------
DEPRECATED FEATURES
-------------------

- Support for the MHPDEBUG environment variable is deprecated and will be
  removed from a future nmh release.  Instead, use the -debug switch to pick.

---------
BUG FIXES
---------

- The format scanner no longer subtracts 1 from the width.  This has the
  effect of no longer counting the trailing newline in the output of
  scan(1), inc(1), and the other programs that rely on the format scanner.
