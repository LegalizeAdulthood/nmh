Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

- All nmh programs will now warn about multiple profile entries for
  the same non-null, non-comment component.  In previous versions, all
  but the first were silently ignored.
- mhmail now supports all post(8) options, and optionally can use
  send(1) with all of its options.  Its formerly undocumented -resent
  switch has been documented.  And it has new -attach, -header-field,
  and -send/-nosend switches.

----------------------------
OBSOLETE/DEPRECATED FEATURES
----------------------------

- Changed exit status of each nmh command's -version and -help
  switches from 1 to 0.
- The following environment variables were deprecated in nmh 1.5
  and are removed from this release:
    MHPOPDEBUG (use -snoop command line switch instead)
    MM_NOASK (use -nolist and -nopause command line switches instead)
    NOMHNPROC (use -nocheckmime command line switch instead)
    FACEPROC (undocumented faceproc feature removed)

  was deprecated in nmh 1.5.  If there are no requests to maintain
  -atfile, it will be removed in the future.
- The undocumented -queue switch to mhmail has been removed.
