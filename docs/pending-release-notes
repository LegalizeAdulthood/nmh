Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

- Switched to buffered output when performing TLS encryption in the SMTP
  MTA to increase performance.
- mh-e support has been changed so that it is always compiled into nmh;
  old features that were previously enabled by the MHE option have been
  garbage collected.
- Old code enabled by the UCI preprocessor definition has been
  garbage-collected.
- LOCKDIR is now configurable via --enable-lockdir
- All configuration options that were formerly only adjustable via editing
  config.h have been removed.
- Support for the built-in ftp client (used when dealing with external body
  message parts in MIME messages) has been removed.
- fileproc and mhlproc mh-profile entries will now be obeyed by
  send, rcvdist, and whatnow.
- New format instructions %(putlit) and %(concataddr) have been implemented.
- The --enable-pop configure option has been removed; POP support is now
  compiled in always.
- You can now filter the body of a message through a user-defined filter
  program inside of repl (the idea is that it will be used by repl).
  See mhl(1), specifically the "format" keyword and "formatproc" in
  mh-profile(5).
- The test suite has been integrated into the Makefile via "make check".
- The following environment variables are obsolete.  Support for them
  will be removed from the next nmh release:
    MHPOPDEBUG (use -snoop command line switch instead)
    MM_NOASK (use -nolist and -nopause command line switches instead)
    NOMHNPROC (use -nocheckmime command line switch instead)
    FACEPROC (undocumented faceproc feature to be removed)
