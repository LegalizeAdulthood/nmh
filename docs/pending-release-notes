Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

- All nmh programs will now warn about multiple profile entries for the
  same component.  In previous versions, all but the first were
  silently ignored.

----------------------------
OBSOLETE/DEPRECATED FEATURES
----------------------------

- Changed exit status of each nmh command's -version and -help
  switches from 1 to 0.
- The following environment variables were deprecated in nmh 1.5
  and are removed from this release:
    MHPOPDEBUG (use -snoop command line switch instead)
    MM_NOASK (use -nolist and -nopause command line switches instead)
    NOMHNPROC (use -nocheckmime command line switch instead)
    FACEPROC (undocumented faceproc feature removed)
- Changed repl and dist default to -noatfile.  The default of -atfile
  was deprecated in nmh 1.5.  If there are no requests to maintain
  -atfile, it will be removed in the future.
