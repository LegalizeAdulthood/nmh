Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

- Switched to buffered output when performing TLS encryption in the SMTP
  MTA to increase performance.
- mh-e support has been changed so that it is always compiled into nmh;
  old features that were previously enabled by the MHE option have been
  garbage collected.
- Old code enabled by the UCI preprocessor definition has been
  garbage-collected.
- LOCKDIR is now configurable via --enable-lockdir
- All configuration options that were formerly only adjustable via editing
  config.h have been removed.
- Support for the built-in ftp client (used when dealing with external body
  message parts in MIME messages) has been removed.
- fileproc and mhlproc mh-profile entries will now be obeyed by
  send, rcvdist, and whatnow.
- New mh-format(5) instructions have been implemented: %(putlit),
  %(concataddr), %(myhost), %(myname)
- The --enable-pop configure option has been removed; POP support is now
  compiled in always.
- You can now filter the body of a message through a user-defined filter
  program inside of repl (the idea is that it will be used by repl).
  See mhl(1), specifically the "format" keyword and "formatproc" in
  mh-profile(5).
- The test suite has been integrated into the Makefile via "make check".
- The following environment variables are obsolete.  Support for them
  will be removed from the next nmh release:
    MHPOPDEBUG (use -snoop command line switch instead)
    MM_NOASK (use -nolist and -nopause command line switches instead)
    NOMHNPROC (use -nocheckmime command line switch instead)
    FACEPROC (undocumented faceproc feature to be removed)
- nmh's idea of the local mailbox is available via a new mh-profile(5)
  escape, %(localmbox).  The local mailbox name is now configurable
  via a new mh-profile(5) entry, Local-Mailbox.
- comp, forw, and dist all support -from, -to, -cc, -fcc, and -subject
  switches.  They also all process all component templates through
  mh-format(5).
- post(8) now requires a From: header in all drafts that it processes
  for sending.  The default component templates have all been adjusted
  to include appropriate From: headers based on either the -from switch
  or the local mailbox.
- burst(1) now supports any valid message delimiter according to RFC 934.
- A problem with the MD5 digest calculator on 64-bit systems has been fixed.
- Fixed mhbuild -check to properly insert Content-MD5 header.
- Fixed mhlist -verbose to work with all content types [Bug #35219].
- Fixed file descriptor leaks in mhparse [Bug #24004: (debbug 344182)].
- Fixed mhstore to honor nmh-storage profile entry even with -auto
  [Bug #35303].
- post(8) can now explicitly control the SMTP envelope address either via
  the Sender: header or the new Envelope-From: header.
- The -attach option is now the default (using Nmh-Attachment) and
  -attachformat 1 is now the default.
