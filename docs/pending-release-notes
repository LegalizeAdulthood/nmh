  garbage collected.
- Old code enabled by the UCI preprocessor definition has been
  garbage-collected.
- LOCKDIR is now configurable via --enable-lockdir
- All configuration options that were formerly only adjustable via editing
  config.h have been removed.

- fileproc and mhlproc mh-profile entries will now be obeyed by
  send, rcvdist, and whatnow.
