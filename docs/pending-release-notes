Things to add to the release notes for the next full release:

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

- All nmh programs will now warn about multiple profile entries for
  the same non-null, non-comment component.  In previous versions, all
  but the first were silently ignored.
- mhmail now supports all post(8) options, or optionally can use
  send(1) with all of its options.  Its formerly undocumented -resent
  switch has been documented.  And it has new -attach, -headerfield,
  and -send/-nosend switches.
- Default to flock() locking on OpenBSD and Darwin.
- Added -directives support to mhbuild(1) to control whether or not
  mhbuild will honor MIME directives by default.  And added support
  for special #on/#off/#pop directives to control the MIME directive
  processing state.

----------------------------
OBSOLETE/DEPRECATED FEATURES
----------------------------

- Changed exit status of each nmh command's -version and -help
  switches from 1 to 0.

    NOMHNPROC (use -nocheckmime command line switch instead)
