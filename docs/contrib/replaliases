#### If using par (see mhn.defaults), it helps to have its PARINIT
#### environment variable set.  If you really want it to be null,
#### either comment this out or set it to, e.g., ' '.
#### Removed "R" from PARINIT recommendation in par(1) man page so
#### that it doesn't consider words that are too long to be an error.

#### Reply, including text/html (converted to text/plain) and text/plain parts.
#### To ease editing at the What now? prompt, add a line like this to your
#### .mh_profile:
####     mhbuild-next: $EDITOR
#### assuming that your EDTIOR environment variable is set; if not, replace
#### $EDITOR above with the name of your editor.  Without that profile entry,
#### enter "e[dit] $EDITOR" at the What now? prompt.
