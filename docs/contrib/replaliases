#### If using par (see mhn.defaults), it really helps to have its
#### PARINIT environment variable set.  If you really want it to be
#### null, either comment this out or set it to, e.g., ' '.
if [ -z "$PARINIT" ]; then
    PARINIT='rTbgqR B=.,?_A_a Q=_s>|'
    export PARINIT
fi

#### Reply, including text/html (converted to text/plain) and text/plain parts.
#### To ease editing at the What now? prompt, add a line like this to your
#### .mh_profile:
####     mhbuild-next: $EDITOR
#### assuming that your EDTIOR environment variable is set; if not, replace
#### $EDITOR above with the name of your editor.  Without that profile entry,
#### enter "e[dit] $EDITOR" at the What now? prompt.
