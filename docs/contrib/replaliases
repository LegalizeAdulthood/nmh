#### replaliases
####
#### convenience functions for various repl(1) commands
#### They're functions instead of aliases for portability.

#### If using par (see mhn.defaults), it helps to have its PARINIT
#### environment variable set.  If you really want it to be null,
#### either comment this out or set it to, e.g., ' '.
#### Removed "R" from PARINIT recommendation in par(1) man page so
#### that it doesn't consider words that are too long to be an error.
if [ -z "$PARINIT" ]; then
    PARINIT='rTbgq B=.,?_A_a Q=_s>|'
    export PARINIT
fi

#### Reply, including text/html (converted to text/plain) and
#### text/plain parts.
####
#### Optional arguments:
####   -h to disable conversion of text/html parts
####   -p to disable conversion of text/plain parts
#### All other arguments are passed to repl.
#### The -p argument can be useful with improperly structured
#### messages, such as those that use multipart/related when they
#### should have used multipart/alternative.
