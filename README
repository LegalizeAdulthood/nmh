-----------
what is it?
-----------
nmh (new MH) is an electronic mail handling system.  It was
originally based on the package MH-6.8.3, and is intended to be
a (mostly) compatible drop-in replacement for MH.

Although development of nmh is ongoing, it appears to be generally
stable and is in current use.  But it is possible that I may break
things as changes are made.

--------------
installing nmh
--------------
To install nmh, check the INSTALL and MACHINES files.  If you have
previously used MH, check the file DIFFERENCES for a list of the
differences between nmh and MH.

--------------------------------
ftp and web sites, mailing lists
--------------------------------
To find out about the mailing lists, ftp sites, and web page
for nmh, check the FAQ included in this distribution.

---------------
nmh maintenance
---------------
nmh is currently being developed and maintained by
Richard Coleman <coleman@math.gatech.edu>.  Please send bug reports
and suggestions to the nmh development mailing list at
nmh-workers@math.gatech.edu.

----------------
acknowledgments
----------------
I would like to give credit where it is due.  nmh could never have
been developed without all the hard work that the RAND Corporation
and the University of California put into the development of the
MH message system, that nmh is based on.

Also, since I've used the version of (v)snprintf() from the
Apache web server, I need to make the following acknowlegement:

This product includes software developed by the Apache Group
for use in the Apache HTTP server project (http://www.apache.org/).
