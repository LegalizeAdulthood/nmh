Installing
----------
Please read the INSTALL file.

Copying
-------
nmh uses a BSD-style license, which should be in the top-level of the
distribution in a file named COPYRIGHT.

Developers
----------
Information of interest to nmh developers can be found in
the README.developers file in the docs subdirectory of this
distribution.  If you're hacking on the code, you should also
definately subscribe to the nmh-workers mailing list. To do so, send
mail to nmh-workers-request@mhost.com with the subject "subscribe". If
you're interested in working on nmh, but aren't sure what to do, see
the TODO file in the docs subdirectory. There's plenty of work there.

Working with your shell
-----------------------
The files COMPLETION-TCSH and COMPLETION-ZSH in the docs subdirectory
give cookbook examples of how to use the enhanced features of
these shells with nmh. There is also a section in Jerry Peek's book
covering nmh/MH and working with the shell. The section is available
online here: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~mh/book/mh/mhanthsh.htm

For More information
--------------------
There is more information, including a FAQ and a bit of historical
information in the docs subdirectory. There are also links to further
documentation on the nmh website located at http://www.mhost.com/nmh/ .
