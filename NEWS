# NEWS - Release notes for nmh 1.5
#

Welcome to nmh, the new version of the classic MH mail handling
system.  Long-time MH and nmh users should read carefully the NOTABLE
CHANGES section, as there are some subtle but significant changes
to the way nmh now behaves.  Otherwise, please see the README and INSTALL
files for help on getting started with nmh.

------------
NEW FEATURES
------------

The following are new features for the 1.5 release of nmh.

- Improved performance for TLS encryption of the SMTP protocol.
- MH-E and POP support are now always compiled in.
- The selection of a locking directory for dot-locking files is now
  controllable via configure.
- fileproc and mhlproc mh-profile are now obeyed by send, rcvdist,
  and whatnow.
- New mh-format instructions have been implemented: %(putlit),
  %(concataddr), %(myhost), %(myname), %(localmbox).  See mh-format(5)
  for more details.
- Nmh's idea of the local mailbox is now configurable via a new profile
  entry, Local-Mailbox.  See mh-profile(5) for more details.
- comp, forw, and dist now process all component templates through
  mh-format(5), and now all support new command line arguments -from,
  -to, -cc, -fcc, and -subject.
- burst(1) now supports any valid message delimiter according to RFC 934.
- post(8) now requires a From: header in all drafts that it processes;
  see NOTABLE CHANGES below for more details.
- post(8) can now explicitly control the SMTP envelope address either via
  the Sender: header or the new Envelope-From: header.
- The -attach option is now the default for send (using the header
  Nmh-Attachment) and -attachformat 1 is the default attachment type.
- repl and dist now support new switches -atfile and -noatfile to control
  the creation of the ./@ link to the message being replied or
  redistributed.  The current default is -atfile.
- Support (if available) for readline editing and filename completion at
  the WhatNow? prompt.
- Support for using an external command to filter the body of a message
  through in mhl.  See mhl(1) for more details, specifically, the
  "format" keyword, the "formatproc" entry in mh-profile(5), and the
  -fmtproc switch for mhl and repl.
- Preliminary support for improved MIME handling when replying to messages!
  Yes, a long requested feature has a solution.  A perl script
  called replyfilter is available; it is designed to act as a mhl
  external filter to process MIME messages in a more logical way.
  It is available in $(srcdir)/docs/contrib/replyfilter or is
  typically installed as $(prefix)/share/doc/nmh/contrib/replyfilter.
  See the comments at the top of replyfilter for usage information;
  it will likely require some adjustment for your site.  replyfilter
  requires the MIME-Tools and MailTools perl modules.

----------------------------
OBSOLETE/DEPRECATED FEATURES
----------------------------

The following features have either been removed completely or marked
as officially deprecated for removal in a future release of nmh.

- The creation of the ./@ link to the message being replied or
  redistributed is deprecated; -noatfile will be the default in the
  next release.  If there are no requests to maintain -atfile it
  will be removed in a future release.
- Old code enabled by the UCI preprocessor definition has been removed.
- All configuration options that were formerly only adjustable by editing
  config.h have either been moved into configure or removed completely.
- Support for the built-in ftp client (used when dealing with external-body
  message parts in MIME messages) has been removed.
- The following environment variables are marked as obsolete/deprecated.
  Support for them will be removed from the next nmh release:
    MHPOPDEBUG (use -snoop command line switch instead)
    MM_NOASK (use -nolist and -nopause command line switches instead)
    NOMHNPROC (use -nocheckmime command line switch instead)
    FACEPROC (undocumented faceproc feature to be removed)
- The hostable option of mts.conf is no longer needed and has been removed.

NOTABLE CHANGES
---------------

The largest change is that post(8) now requires a From: header in all drafts
that it processes.

The impetus for this change has been the evolution of email and client
systems.  When MH was first developed the norm was to have tightly managed
clients that were part of the same domain as a user's email address.  This
is no longer a valid assumption, and the algorithm used by nmh to determine
the user's local mailbox is no longer a reasonable default.

Unfortunately, the way that nmh uses the user's local mailbox used to happen
very late in the message process; it was handled by post during message
submission.  If no From: header exists in the current draft post would
insert one based on it's idea of the local mailbox, which was frequently
wrong.

After a long discussion within the nmh development community, it was
decided that the only reasonable way forward was to move the local mailbox
handling up a level and place it under more direct control of the end
user.  post(8) no longer will try to determine the local mailbox name;
it will take that information from the draft message.  Thus a From: header
is now required in all drafts.

As part of these changes, all message composition utilities now process
their component files using mh-format.  All of the default component
files have been modified to include a From: header in them; this will
give the user a chance to see nmh's idea of the local mailbox and modify
it if desired.  The new mh-profile(5) entry Local-Mailbox can be used
to adjust the local mailbox name if the system default is not appropriate.

So how should end-users adapt to these changes?  Here are some suggestions:

1) If you use the default component files, everything should basically work
   the same for you.  You should see a From: header in the drafts of your
   messages.  If the address you see in the From: header is incorrect
   you can change it via the Local-Mailbox profile entry.  You can also
   use the -from switch to change it on a per-command basis.

2) If you have custom component files that include a From: header or
   you perform custom processing on drafts that end up placing a From:
   header in the draft message, everything should work as before.

3) If you have custom component files that do NOT include a From: header
   then you will have to adapt then to include a From: header.  You
   can either simply hard-code the correct From: header or use the
   default component files as a guide (see mh-format(5) for more
   details, specifically the %(localmbox) function).

The other significant change is the support for filters in mhl.  Included
in the distribution is replyfilter, a filter designed for sane processing
of MIME messages during replies.  Since this isn't as integrated into
nmh as we would prefer, it's included in the contrib directory as an
optional component.  Please try it out and give us feedback.

# NEWS - Release notes for nmh 1.4
#

This releases contains numerous bugfixes and a number of new features.
The new features include:

- SASL security layers (encryption) are now supported for the SMTP MTA.
- TLS is now supported for the SMTP MTA.
- inc can now incorporate mail from Maildir drops.
- You can now select the SMTP server and port from either "send" or a
  user's mh_profile (you could always select the server; that option is
  now documented).  These are available via the -server and -port
  switches.
- All networking code has been modified to use the new networking APIs
  (getaddrinfo and friends).  All networking code (with the exception of
  the built-in ftp client) now supports IPv6.
- New commands 'new', 'fnext', 'fprev', and 'unseen' for showing folders
  with unseen mail (or mail in any specified sequence), changing to next
  such folder, changing to previous such folder, and scanning all such
  folders, respectively.  This is based on Luke Mewburn's 'new':
  http://www.mewburn.net/luke/src/new
- nmh will no longer attempt to install a mhn.defaults file that causes
  mhshow to open its own xterms.

A large chunk of old code has been garbage collected.  Specifically,
support for APOP, RPOP, NNTP (including bboards) and MPOP is now gone.
Also gone is support for prefixing a \01 in the "servers" entry in
mts.conf to iterate over all servers on a named network.

# NEWS - Release notes for nmh 1.3
#

It's been over two years since the 1.2 release; but the changes here are
mostly minor; largely bugfixes.

You should note that we have changed the default configuration to allow
all supported forms of address masquerading. For more details please see
the --enable-masquerade option to configure, and the mh-tailor and post
man pages.
