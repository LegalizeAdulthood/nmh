.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIPackf\fR will pack copies of messages from a folder, into a single
file.

If the `-mbox' switch is given (the default), then the messages are
separated using mbox (uucp) style delimiters.  This is the format used
by most mail clients (elm, mailx, etc.).

If the `-mmdf' switch is given, then the messages are separated by
mmdf style delimiters.  Each message in the file is separated by four
CTRL\-A's and a newline.

You may specify the name of the file in which to use with the
`\-file\ name' switch.  If you do specify the name of the file, it
will default to `msgbox'.

If the given file name points to an existing file, then the specified
messages will be appended to the end of the file, otherwise the file
will be created and the messages appended.

Messages that are packed by \fIpackf\fR can be unpacked using
\fIinc\fR.
