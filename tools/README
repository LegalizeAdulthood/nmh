This directory contains tools, scripts, and supporting files used
by the developers while writing, debugging, and testing the code.
By definition, anything in this directory is not portable.  The
files can (and probably do) depends on specific programs being
installed, might only run on a specific operating system release,
or have dependacies on the ritual sacrifice of politicians.

In the interest of consistency, scripts or programs placed here
should be written to be invoked from the top-level nmh source code
directory.  E.g., 'tools/csa' should do the right thing when run
from this directory's parent.  If that's not possible, please add
a note here or in the relevant script saying how to run things.
