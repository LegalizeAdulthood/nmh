This directory contains 3rd-party code we use in the build.  The
sources here are unmodified from their original distribution.  The
MH build makefiles reference the code here via VPATH directives.

If you need to modify the source to any of these packages, make a
copy of the source file in the MH build tree, commit the pristine
copy, then make your changes to that copy.  This greatly simplifies
merging any MH-specific customizations when a new version of the
3rd-party code is imported.

DO NOT modify any of the files here from their original distribution!
