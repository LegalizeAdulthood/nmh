1999-02-06  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-1.0.

	* Merged mbx_open and mbx_Xopen in dropsbr.c.  Fixed
	  mbx_open so that the mode of zero length maildrops
	  would not be changed.

	* Replaced the substitute version of snprintf() with the
	  one from the Apache web server.

	* Changed to default mode for creating new messages to 0600
	  (this should have been done a long time ago).

	* Changed "flist" to handle searching for multiple sequences
	  for each folder.  Also flist will now correctly split
	  Unseen-Sequence if it consists of multiple sequences.

	* Added new switches `-unlink' and `-nounlink' to "refile".

	* Added new switches `-unlink' and `-nounlink' to "rmm".

	* More cleanups of slocal output.  Changed adorn() to
	  send to stdout, instead of stderr (to match rest of
	  verbose printing).

	* Merged mbx_create() into mbx_open, so that creating and
	  opening a nonexistent maildrop is done atomically.  This
	  removes a bad race condition.

	* Fixed bug that caused slocal to be unable to save to MMDF
	  style drop file.

	* Added new wrapper function usr_folder() to slocal.c to
	  handle adding message to folder (currently, it still uses
	  usr_pipe() to call rcvstore).

	* seq_list() checks for empty folder before scanning for
	  sequence information.

	* num_digits() in flist.c and folder.c now returns correct
	  value for 0.  Also added sanity check.

	* folder_delmsgs() now correctly decrements internal message
	  count.

	* Don't attempt to read sequence information if folder
	  is empty.

	* Split seq_read into seq_public and seq_private.

	* Small change to sigmsg.awk, since newer versions of gawk
	  interpret 034 as octal.

	* In flist, don't scan for sequence information in empty folder.

	* Updated mhn.defaults.sh to output profile entries for mhshow,
	  mhstore, and mhbuild.

	* Changed configuration parameter "mhn-access-ftp" to
	  "nmh-access-ftp".  Updated man pages

	* Moved the code in InitMultipart to reverse the order of the
	  parts in a multipart, into its own function "reverse_parts()".

	* Changed code in mhbuildsbr.c to store unencoded content
	  in the c_cefile structure when building.

	* Changed code in mhoutsbr.c to look for unencoded content
	  in the c_cefile structure when outputing message.

	* Changed configuration parameter "mhn-cache" and
	  "mhn-private-cache", to "nmh-cache" and "nmh-private-cache",
	  since it is used in mhstore, mhlist, and mhshow.  Updated man pages

	* Change configuration parameter "mhn-storage" to
	  "nmh-storage", since it is now used in mhstore, mhlist,
	  and mhshow.  Updated man pages

	* Add autoconf support for KPOP (kerberized pop).

	* Add autoconf support for Hesiod.

	* Split routines to output a message given a Content structure
	  (output_message, output_content, write7Bit, etc..) to a new
	  file "mhoutsbr.c".

	* Split output_content(), into output_content() and build_headers().

	* Changed copy_some_headers() in mhstoresbr.c, to use the linked
	  list of header fields, rather than reopening the message.

	* Added free_header() to mhfree.c to free structures containing
	  header field information.

	* Changed get_content() to use the linked list of header fields
	  when parsing the various MIME headers (Content-XXX).

	* Changed get_content() to store linked list of header field
	  values when parsing a content.

	* Changed mhbuild, mhn, mhlist, mhshow, mhstore, to use the
	  routines in mhcachesbr.c to handle the content cache.

	* Split various funtions (find_cache, find_cache_aux, find_cache_aux2,
	  cache_content) into new file mhcachesbr.c.

	* More calls to sprintf/strcpy (primarily in mhparse.c
	  and mhbuildsbr.c) converted to snprintf/strncpy.

	* When a message is displayed with `mhshow', it is now
	  removed from the "unseen" sequence.

	* Change the default "showmimeproc" to "mhshow".

	* Split "mhn -show" off into separate command "mhshow".

	* Split "mhn -store" off into separate command "mhstore".

	* Split "mhn -list" off into separate command "mhlist".

	* Add sanity checks to context_find(), context_replace(),
	  and context_del(), to abort if context file hasn't been
	  read.

	* Add calls to context_read(), to the beginning of all nmh
	  commands (instead of being called indirectly by context_find).

	* Changes the "substitute" version of vsnprintf/snprintf for
	  operating systems without native versions, to just call the
	  native vsprintf(), and ignore the buffer length.   This is
	  faster, but less secure than the previous version that used
	  temporary files.  This should only be a problem for systems
	  which do not have a native snprintf(), and require `inc' to
	  be setuid/setgid.

	* Lots more calls to sprintf/strcpy converted to snprintf/strncpy.

	* Changes client() routine to take additional parameter, which is
	  the buffer length of the parameter "response".  Then added
	  buffer length checks for this parameter.

	* Changed getws() to get_fields(), since that is apparently the
	  name of a wide character version of gets() on some archetitures.

	* Lots of sprintf/strcpy calls converted to snprintf/strncpy.

	* Change the code in most of the commands that take multiple
	  message names/sequences/ranges on the command, such that
	  the msgs array is expanded dynamically.  This removes most
	  of the limits on the length of command lines.

	* Add additional parameter to copyip(), to specify the
	  maximum number of strings that can be copied (security
	  fix).

	* Create new function getarguments(), to massage the argument
	  vector before parsing it (add any arguments from your
	  profile to the beginning of the argument vector).  This
	  also removed the general limit on the number of command line
	  arguments.

1998-07-04  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.27.

	* Added a new command "delete", that is available during
	  a "whatnow" session.  It is equivalent to "quit -delete".

	* Added another parameter to editfile (in whatnowsbr.c),
	  that controls whether editfile should remember the last
	  program that was exec'ed.  This way the whatnow command
	  "mime", will not be re-executed if "edit" is later given
	  with no arguments.

	* Changed whatnowsbr.c, so that whatnow doesn't abort if
	  mhbuild returns an error.

	* Added parameter to sendsbr(), so you may specify whether to
	  rename the draft file.

	* Pass delay time to splitmsg() as a parameter, rather than
	  use a global variable.

	* Moved code to rename draft file after sending message from
	  splitmsg and sendaux, to sendsbr.

	* Removed all the code in viamail to split messages and then
	  mail them.  Replaced this with the standard sendsbr.c routines.

	* Changed sendsbr(), so that when splitting messages into
	  messages of type "message/partial", the header fields that
	  are copied are more compliant with RFC-2046.

	* Fixed mhbuild to track temporary files better.  They are
	  now correctly removed when mhbuild aborts.

	* Created a new man page for "sendfiles".  The information
	  about "mhn -viamail" in the "mhn" man page was moved to
	  this new page.

	* Changed the name of the "viamail" shell script to
	  "sendfiles".  Modified "sendfiles" to use the new
	  viamail program.

	* Moved the functionality for "mhn -viamail" out of mhn,
	  and into a separate executable called "viamail".

	* When storing MIME contents to a folder using mhn -store,
	  they are now accumulated in a temporary file, and then added
	  to the folder using folder_addmsg().

	* Moved code to save content to a folder from store_content
	  to new function output_content_folder.

	* Moved code to save content to file from store_content to
	  new function output_content_file.

	* Moved code to parse storage format string from store_content
	  to new function parse_format_string.

	* Fix copy_some_headers() in mhstoresbr.c, so that the
	  correct header fields in the first enclosing message/partial
	  will be copied (according to RFC2046), when using mhn -store
	  to reassemble messages of type message/partial.

	* Fixed bug to openFTP() in mhparse.c, that caused the
	  tmp file to not be removed, when transferring a
	  message/external file from ftp.

	* Moved the code in mhparse.c to process -auto switch (scan
	  contents for the attribute "name"), to a new function
	  "get_storeproc" in mhstoresbr.c.

	* Moved routines to free data structures related to MIME
	  content from mhparse.c and mhbuildsbr.c, to new file
	  mhfree.c.

	* Moved code to show/display MIME content into new
	  file mhshowsbr.c.

	* Moved code to store MIME content from into
	  new file mhstoresbr.c

	* Moved code to parse MIME content into new
	  file mhparse.c.

	* Moved code to list information about MIME content
	  into new file mhlistsbr.c.

	* Move part_ok(), type_ok(), content_error(), flush_errors(),
	  and set_endian() to new file mhmisc.c.

	* Start to isolate the code to show, list, and store MIME
	  messages.  One side effect is that only one flag (-show,
	  -list, or -store) can be used at a time now.

	* mhn -store -auto wasn't storing file in correct directory.

	* Removed a few dead variables from sbr/ruserpass.c

	* move code for creating tmp files, and renaming the
	  the composition draft in mhbuild, from build_mime()
	  to main().

	* remove left-over code in mhbuild.c, mhbuildsbr.c, for
	  the -[no]auto switch (which isn't used in mhbuild).

	* split mhn.c into mhn.c and mhnsbr.c (name later changed
	  to mhparse.c).

	* split mhbuild.c into mhbuild.c and mhbuildsbr.c.

1998-05-25  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.26.

	* Added (unlisted) options [no]dashstuffing to send, post,
	  and whatnow to determine whether to do RFC934 quoting
	  (dashstuffing) for encapsulated BCC messages.  The default
	  is still the same (dashstuffing).

	* Changed the undocumented feature "nodashmunging" in forw
	  and mhl, into the documented feature "nodashstuffing".  The
	  default for forw, is still "dashstuffing" for backward
	  compatibility, although I don't believe that bursting
	  RFC934 digests is very common anymore.

	* Added an option to define REALLYDUMB in the default config.h.
	  But it is not on by default.

	* moved creation of config file mts.conf from zotnet/mts
	  to etc.  This simplified the Makefile in zotnet/mts.

	* simplified directory support/general to etc.

	* removed unneeded directory support/bboards.

	* split getusername() into getusername() and getuserinfo().

	* Changed getusr() routine to getusername().

	* Slight cleanup in folder_pack.c on code that records the new
	  number of the "cur" message when packing.

1998-05-08  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.25.

	* Change install process, so that hard linking the correct mts
	  library to libmts.a, is not necessary.  The final link process
	  uses the original name of the library.

	* Fixed bug in flist.c and folder.c, so that symbolic links which
	  point to directories, will not decrement the number of directory
	  links remaining.

	* Split the function list_content (in mhn.c and mhbuild.c) into
	  list_content and list_debug.

	* Don't pack (folder -pack) an empty folder.

	* Exit gracefully in flist.c, if no sequence is specified,
	  and no "Unseen-Sequence" is given in nmh profile.

1998-02-27  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.24.

	* Small clarification to the man page for `ali'.

	* Fix bug in inc.c so that if both flags `-file' and `-truncate'
	  are given, that order doesn't matter.

	* Fix bug in seq_list.c when realloc'ing for
	  large sequence line.

1998-02-23  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.23.

	* Add new section on "Transfer Encodings" to man page for mhbuild.

	* In mhbuild.c, split compose_content into compose_content
	  (parse and execute composition string), and scan_content (scan content,
	  decided transfer encoding, check for clash with boundary string).
	  I did a good amount of rearranging of this code.

	* Moved definitions for data structures for parsing MIME
	  messages from mhn.c and mhbuild.c to a new include
	  file h/mhnsbr.h.

	* Small amount of rearranging in sendsbr.c

	* Small changes to MAIL.FILTERING file.

	* Add the file MAIL.FILTERING to nmh distribution.

	* Add line to packf so that if message begins with
	  "X-Envelope-From:" field, it is converted to "From ".

	* Fix packf to add "From " line to beginning of message,
	  even if Return-Path doesn't exist.

	* Add note to MACHINES file that on Linux, configure
	  doesn't find the functions sigsetjmp/siglongjmp.

	* Fix configuration for machines that don't have (or find)
	  sigsetjmp/siglongjmp.

1998-02-11  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.22.

	* Add a configure check for sigsetjmp.  Add some conditional
	  #define's in h/signals.h in case it's not found.

	* Added additional notes about -auto switch in mhn man page.

	* Added note about MM_CHARSET environment variable to
	  mh-profile(5) man page.

	* Fix signal problem in mhn.c (change setjmp/longjmp to
	  sigsetjmp/siglongjmp).

1998-02-09  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.22-pre1.

	* Changed the first line in mhl.format from
	  " -- using template mhl.format -- " to a blank line.

	* Added note about automimeproc to mh-profile man page.

	* Reorganize the main entry point for parsing a MIME message
	  or file in mhn.  Add new function parse_file() as new main
	  entry point for parsing MIME files.

	* Add note to mhn man page, that "mhn -file -" will accept the
	  source message on the standard input.

	* Changed a sanity check in folder_realloc that was too strict.

	* -norfc934mode is now the default for mhbuild,
	  rather than -rfc934mode.

	* Fix mhbuild, so that Content-Description and RFC-822 comments
	  from #forw directive will be correctly included if there is
	  only one message.

	* Change mhn to correctly default parts of multipart/digest to
	  message/rfc822 (leftover code from rfc934mode was removed).

	* Restore HP specific code to zotnet/tws/lexstring.c.  Apparently
	  it is still needed.

1998-02-06  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.21.

	* If the file given to mhbuild is "-", then accept the draft on
	  standard input, and output the MIME message to standard output.

	* Cleaned up code in mhbuild.c that decides what transfer
	  encoding to use.

	* Cleaned up code in mhbuild.c that decides what character set
	  to use for text contents.

	* Removed old hpux specific code from zotnet/tws/lexstring.c

1998-02-02  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.21-pre2.

	* Added the "decode" variable to mhl.format and mhl.header.

	* Added new variable "decode" to mhlsbr.c to decode text in
	  header fields as per RFC-2047.

	* Make sure that when decoding RFC-2047 header fields, that any
	  spaces at the ends of the encoded text are not ignored, but the
	  spaces between encoded word are.

	* Removed #ifdef's for MIME.  MIME support is always compiled in.

	* scan/inc will now decode both Subject and From lines as
	  RFC-2047 encoded header fields.

	* Added new function write_charset_8bit() to sbr.  It returns
	  the character set to use for 8bit text in composition draft.
	  Changed mhbuild to use this function.

	* Split mhn man page into man pages for mhn and mhbuild.

	* mhn -show will only now only use default method for content
	  of type plain, if it is NOT a part of a multipart/alternative.

	* Split mhn -build into mhbuild.  Did some code cleanup.

	* Added support for %(decode) to fmtdump.c.

	* check_charset() now accepts US-ASCII as a subset of any
	  ISO-8859-X character set.

	* Changed the default "showproc" to mhl, instead of the
	  pager more.

	* When reading file into mhn composition file, only need read
	  permissions, not write permissions.

	* Added own version of strcasecmp to distribution, since
	  nmh calls it frequently with NULL pointers (ughh).

	* Replaced uleq.c with strcasecmp.  Removed uleq.c from
	  distribution.

1998-01-22  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.21-pre1.

	* If a message is missing charset parameter to text/plain, show
	  will assume US-ASCII, rather than just calling showmimeproc.

	* Change show.c and mshcmds.c to use check_charset to see if text
	  message contains valid character set.

	* Added new scan format file "scan.nomime" to support/general
	  that doesn't do any RFC-2047 decoding.

	* Modified all the scan format files in support/general to do
	  RFC-2047 decoding of Subject field.

	* Did more work on sbr/fmt_rfc2047.c, so that it will correctly
	  ignore whitespace between two valid encoded words, but not
	  between an encoded word and normal text.

	* Created new file sbr/check_charset.c.  Moved code from
	  fmt_rfc2047.c to check for valid character set to this file.

	* Added format escape %(decode) to decode contents of "str" register
	  as a RFC-2047 header field.

	* The command install-mh now recognizes the switches -version
	  and -help.

	* Added a new argument to print_help.c to decide whether to
	  print profile entries (needed for install-mh to prevent weird
	  loops).

	* Changed folder_read.c and folder_realloc.c so that mp->lowoff
	  is initialize to max (mp->lowmsg, 1) rather than always 1.

	* Changed macros for sequence/attribute manipulation so that
	  message status array doesn't need to always start at 1.

	* Small cleanups in folder_realloc().

1998-01-09  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.20.

	* Added configure option --with-pager=PAGER.

	* Added configure option --with-editor=EDITOR.

	* Changed the default format file for mhl (mhl.format) to
	  also ignore (not display) the header fields Content-Type,
	  Content-Transfer-Encoding, and Content-ID

	* Fixed core dump in addrsbr.c when using %(proper) format function
	  and the To: line was missing.

	* Added the file ZSH.COMPLETION to the distribution.

1998-01-04  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.20-pre2.

	* Added new switch -snoop to both `msgchk' and `inc', so you can
	  watch the POP transaction.

	* Changed "replgroupcomps" to check for Mail-Followup-To header
	  first, and use it if available.

	* Changed "replcomps" to check for Mail-Reply-To header
	  first, and use it if available.

1998-01-03  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.20-pre1.

	* Changed seq_list.c to dynamically enlarge the buffer for
	  collecting the message ranges in a long sequence line.
	  This should remove the last hard limit on the size of a
	  sequence line.

	* Changed seq_read.c so that can read long sequence lines.
	  It will use multiple calls to m_getfld() when m_getfld()
	  returns the state FLDPLUS.

	* Changed brkstring.c to dynamically add more space for pointers
	  if necessary.  This is needed when splitting up large sequence
	  lines.

	* Did some small cleanups in seq_save.c.

	* Added new switches `-[no]unseen' to rcvstore, to control
	  whether new messages are added to Unseen-Sequence.

	* Moved locking routines (zotnet/mts/lock.c) to sbr/lock_file.c

	* Changed the internal UNSEEN flag to SELECT_UNSEEN which is
	  more appropriate.  Changed the MHPATH flag to ALLOW_NEW.

	* Changed "replcomps" to not include CC and TO lines so that
	  that reply message is only directed at the author of the
	  message to which you are replying.

	* Added new switch `-group' to command repl, which causes repl
	  to use new forms file "replgroupcomps".  This is intended for
	  making group replies.

	* Removed #ifdef for ATHENA.

1997-12-28  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.19.

	* Fix repl,forw so that switch `-form file' will not abort
	  as ambiguious (silly mistake on my part).

	* Cleaned up the mhn man page.  Added info about a few escapes
	  for the formatting/display strings that were not documented
	  (%%, %t).  Moved the BNF grammar for the mime composition file,
	  to the end of the man page.

	* Added the options -[no]format to the command repl.  The
	  switch `-format' will filter the message to which you are
	  replying with the standard message filter "mhl.reply", which
	  is now included in the distribution.  The `-noformat' option
	  will negate the use of -format or -filter and not include
	  the message to which you are replying in the draft.

	* Did some cleaning and reorganization on many of the man
	  pages.

	* Added debugging switch `-debug' to mhparam, which displays
	  the values of all `procs' (and some other misc configuration
	  info) that nmh keeps in global variables.

	* When using `refile -preserve', if a conflict occurs, then use
	  the next available number above the message number you wish
	  to preserve.

	* In forw.c, split the code for creating MIME style forwarding
	  out of copy_draft, and into copy_mime_draft.

	* Move routines in mark.c to print sequences, into new
	  file sbr/seq_print.c

	* flist will now update the current folder.

	* Added the switches -[no]fast to flist, to replace
	  -[no]total.  The previous switches are still accepted
	  but now undocumented.

	* More reorganization in flist of the code for
	  traversing folders.

	* The command "flist +foo -all" will now scan the folder
	  "foo" and all its 1st level children.

	* Add missing include file <h/mh.h> to sbr/snprintf.c

	* Fix alarm bug in rcvtty, so that when it calls external
	  process, the alarm is never longer than 30 minutes.

1997-12-17  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.18.

	* Fixed bug in mark, so that "mark -list -seq foo" will
	  correctly indicate if "foo" is a private sequence.  I found
	  this bug mentioned in Jerry Peek's book.

	* Simplified the code in seq_setcur(), since seq_addmsg() now
	  retains the public/private status of sequences.

	* Changed sequence handling so that if the switches -public
	  or -nopublic, are not specified for the commands mark, pick,
	  or rcvstore, then existing sequences will retain their
	  previous public/private status.

	* mhparam now handles the mh-sequences profile entry
	  correctly.

	* flist -all will now also check readonly folders (for
	  private sequences).

	* Improve the leaf optimization for folder command.
	  It will now track the number of directories in a folder,
	  and stop stat'ing files once it has hit all the subfolders.

	* Renamed m_getfolder to getfolder.  Changed getfolder to
	  take option to determine whether it should get current
	  folder, or just default folder (Inbox).  Changed rcvstore,
	  inc, and rmf to use the new getfolder.

	* flist now indicates if a sequence is private.

	* Change WUNTRACED to 0, in pidwait.c, so that commands will
	  wait for stopped processes.

	* conflict will dynamically allocate space for group names,
	  so it can now handle system with more than 100 groups.

1997-12-09  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.18-pre4.

	* Check if we have enough message status space, before we
	  call folder_realloc() in burst, mhpath, and m_draft().

	* mhn will now correctly identify a formatting string of "-"
	  for the option -store, and send content to stdout.

	* Change the way that memory for message status is
	  allocated.  It is dynamcially allocated separately from
	  the folder/message structure.  This required changing
	  folder_read.c, folder_realloc.c, folder_free.c.

	* Removed all the MTR code (experimental code for message
	  status allocation).

	* Renamed m_readfolder.c to folder_read.c and simplified
	  the code.

	* Renamed m_freefolder.c to folder_free.c.

	* Add function trim() to slocal.c to pretty print
	  the debugging output.

	* Changed the name of m_packfolder() to folder_pack().
	  Changed the name of m_remsg() to folder_realloc().

Wed Dec  3 23:33:38 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.18-pre3.

	* Changed installation to add `flists' which is hard linked
	  to `flist'.  This is a equivalent to `flist -all'.

	* For flist, -showzero is on by default.

	* Major changes to flist.  Default is now for flist to search
	  current folder.  The switch `-all' is now used to specify
	  searching all top level folders.  The new switch `-showzero'
	  is used to print out folders that don't contain any messages
	  in the given sequence.

	* Split BuildFolderList in flist.c into 2 functions
	  (BuildFolderList, BuildFolderListR).  Changed these functions
	  so that flist now does better leaf optimization, and will stop
	  stat'ing directory entries when it knows it has hit all the
	  subdirectories of a given directory.

	* Reorganized code in folder.c, so that all relevant folders
	  are scanned first and information recorded.  Then all the
	  folder summaries at printed out at one time.

	* Made the options of folder(s) more orthogonal.  Now
	  "folder -all -noheader -nototal" will do the right thing.

	* Added `-noall' switch to folder, for completeness.

	* Changed the default mode for creation of new folders
	  to 0700 (was 0711).

	* Slightly changed the format for flist.  It now indicates
	  if a folder is current.  Also the width of the various
	  fields are now calculated at runtime.

	* Changed the format for folder(s).  Folder names
	  are now left justified.  The width of the various fields
	  are calculated at runtime.

Sun Nov 30 19:14:53 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.18-pre2.

	* Add paragraph to man page for install-mh and to INSTALL file
	  about checking for global mh.profile.

	* Renamed m_find() to context_find().
	  Renamed m_replace() to context_replace().
	  Renamed m_delete() to context_del().
	  Renamed m_update() to context_save().
	  Renamed m_getdefs() to context_read().
	  Renamed m_foil() to context_foil().

	* Change rcvstore to use routine folder_addmsg(), instead of
	  adding message to folder itself.

	* Changed refile, so that if the switch -preserve is used,
	  and a conflict occurs for a particular folder, then folder_addmsg()
	  will just use next highest available number for that folder,
	  instead of exiting.

	* Make folder_addmsg() more robust.  It will make repeated
	  attempts to link file into folder if link returns with
	  the error EEXIST.

	* Fix bug, so that that if forking sendmail, HELO will be sent
	  unless clientname: option is defined but empty (so now it
	  is the same as the direct smtp code).

	* Changed sprintb to snprintb (now we pass the buffer length
	  to new routine).  Changed code to use new function.

	* Added snprintf to sbr. Added configure check to build it
	  if you don't have a native version (but haven't changed much
	  code to use it yet).

Thu Nov 13 18:42:18 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.18-pre1.

	* Fixed alarm bug in slocal, so that alarm is never
	  called with a value larger than 30 mintues.

	* Fixed race condition in rmm and refile, so that
	  context is updated before external rmmproc is called.

	* Removed all the OVERHEAD code.

	* Move code to add message to folder from refile.c
	  to folder_addmsg.c

Fri Jul 25 19:39:29 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Did some rearranging of the internals of inc.c.

	* Make -inplace the default for anno, forw, dist, and repl.

	* Changed --enable-smtp to --with-mts={smtp,sendmail}

	* Removed all the MF (uucp filtering) code.

	* Removed all the code for BERK.

	* Removed all the code for stand-alone delivery (MHMTS).

	* Split the file mts/sendmail/smail.c into sendmail.c and

	  configuration files.

	* Changed #define in mhn.c from FTP to BUILTIN_FTP.

Mon Jul 21 03:22:34 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.17.

	* MAKEDEFS weren't passed down to recursive makes correctly.

	* slocal.c now checks for UTMP_FILE and _PATH_UTMP instead
	  of hard-coding "/etc/utmp".

	* rcvtty.c check for _PATH_UTMP if UTMP_FILE is not
	  defined.

	* Remove configure checks for ulong and ushort.  Changed
	  code to just use unsigned {short, long}.

	* Change addmsg function in refile.c to return new
	  number of refiled message.

	* Added check in get_returnpath for empty unixbuf.

	* Cleanup of sbr/pidstatus to use more POSIX macros
	  for return value of wait().

	* Change configure to also check /bin for "more".

Sat Jul 12 00:02:23 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.16.

Mon Jun 23 20:13:24 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Added automimeproc, which should replace automhnproc.

	* multipart messages will no longer abort for messages
	  of type 8bit or binary (although we still can't really
	  deal with binary messages, yet).

	* Fix double free of c_storage.  From John MacMillan.

	* mhn now treats unknown subtypes of "text" as text/plain.

	* mhn changed so that specifying mhn-show-multipart, or
	  mhn-show-multipart/{mixed, alternate, etc...) will override
	  the use of the internal method for displaying these types.
	  Previously mhn would always use the internal method for subtypes
	  mixed, alternate, digest, and parallel (even if an alternate
	  method was specified in mhn.defaults).

	* mhn show treats unknown subtypes of multipart, as type
	  multipart/mixed (as specified RFC2046).

	* mhn checks for the parameter "name" rather than "x-name".
	  From MH-6.8.4 patch.

	* Fix double free of ctinfo in user_content when using
	  #forw with single message.  From John MacMillan (and
	  MH-6.8.4 patch).

	* Changed -mhnproc switch for show, to -showmimeproc.

	* Changed profile entry "mhnproc" to "showmimeproc".

	* Added "mime" option to "whatnow", which calls the program
	  "buildmimeproc" (default is mhn -build) to process MIME
	   composition files.

	* Added -build switch to mhn, to process MIME composition
	  files.

	* Did some reorganizing of mhn.c.

	* Changed casting in mts/sendmail/smail.c from (char) to
	  (signed char) so SMTP reply codes work correctly for machines
	  which used unsigned chars by default.

Sat Jun 21 01:21:47 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.15.

	* Added new form "scan.unseen" to distribution.  It marks messages
	  which are in any sequence in Unseen-Sequence.

	* Do some rearranging of date/time code in zotnet/tws/dtime.c

	* Fix sign extension bugs in fmt_scan.c.

	* Fix m_atoi.c so that strings ending in non-digit characters
	  return 0.

	* Split code in burst.c so that finding delimiters of digested
	  messages and bursting a message into multiple messages are
	  two separate functions (find_delim and burst).

	* Add workaround fo AC_PATH_PROG in configure.in, so
	  that BSD4.4 machines can find sendmail, vi, more.

	* Added "-width" option to rcvtty.

	* Change a few variable names in zotnet/mts/client.c since
	  they conflict with defines on AIX.

	* Makefile in zotnet/tws assumes lexing of dtimep.lex was
	  unsuccessful if resulting file is less than 500 lines long
	  (rather than 10, which was previous value), since AIX
	  sed gives mangled file of about 200 lines.

	* Extract code in rcvstore.c to link message into folder,
	  and put in own subroutine.

	* Extract code in refile.c to link message into folder,
	  and put in own subroutine.

	* Moved code to remove messages from folder into own
	  routine "folder_delmsgs" in sbr.  Changed rmm.c and
	  refile.c to use new routine.

Fri May 16 06:09:31 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Renamed m_seqok to seq_nameok.

	* Changed m_setunseen, msh, mshcmds, flist, and scan to use
	  seq_getnum.

	* Changed m_seqflag to return the number of a sequence rather
	  than its bit flag.  Changed its name to seq_getnum and renamed
	  file to sbr/seq_getnum.c.

	* Removed function m_seqnew and file sbr/m_seqnew.c since it is
	  no longer used.

	* Added zero switch to m_seqadd function to zero out bits before
	  adding message to sequence.

	* Renamed function m_setvis to m_setunseen, and renamed
	  corresponding file in sbr.

	* Renamed function m_setseq to m_setprev, and renamed corresponding
	  file in sbr.

	* Changed mark.c and pick.c to use m_seqaddsel and m_seqdelsel.

	* Added new function m_seqdelsel to m_seqdel.c, which deletes
	  all selected messages from a sequence.

	* Added new function m_seqaddsel to m_seqadd.c, which adds all
	  selected messages to a sequence.

	* Split sbr/m_seqnew.c into m_seqadd.c, m_seqdel.c, m_seqnew.c,
	  and m_seqok.c.

Thu May 15 00:53:17 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Renamed function pack_folder to m_packfolder, and moved it
	  from uip/folder.c into its own file sbr/m_packfolder.c

Wed May 14 23:38:00 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed function m_gmsg to m_readfolder.  Renamed file
	  sbr/m_gmsg.c to sbr/m_readfolder.c.

Mon May  5 19:57:11 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Added new options `-checkmime', `-nocheckmime', and `-mhnproc'
	  to show.  Restructured code to handle options to various
	  `procs' better.  Deprecated `-noshowproc' option and NOMHNPROC
	  environment variable.

	* Added new man page `mh-draft' which documents the
	  draft folder facility in nmh.

	* Renamed fmtsbr.h to fmt_scan.h.  Renamed fmtcompile.h
	  to fmt_compile.h.

	* split fmtsbr.c into fmt_scan.c and fmt_new.c.  Renamed
	  fmtcompile.c to fmt_compile.c, and formataddr.c to
	  fmt_addr.c.

	* `send -help' wasn't showing the -(no)mime and -split
	  options.

Fri Apr 25 02:50:36 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.13.

	* Changed mhpath so it doesn't abort if a message sequence
	  such as "mhpath all" expands to more than 1000 messages.
	  Also mhpath now dynamically reallocated space for message
	  names (The number of command line arguments is still limited
	  to MAXARGS).

	* Did some general restructuring of the code in folder.c
	  that checks for folder information, and prints it.

Thu Apr 24 01:04:37 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed `folder' to reallocate space for folder names if
	  necessary.  So `folders' can now handle more than 300 folders.

Tue Apr 22 14:01:26 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Change configure to use a compile check to see if the tm struct
	  has tm_gmtoff, rather than using egrep.

Mon Apr 21 02:19:17 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.12.

	* Had set_exists and unset_exists macros backwards.

	  `procs' (mhlproc, showproc, lproc, etc...).

	* Replace the bit twiddling for SELECTED, UNSEEN, and
	  mp->attrstats with macros.

	* If system doesn't have SIGEMT (like Linux), then use SIGTERM
	  in msh.c instead.

	* Change fstat to stat in m_gmsg.c since Linux wants
	  to hide dd->dd_fd.

	* Merge Linux patch sent in by Michel Oosterhof (original
	  patch from bsa@kf8nh.wariat.org).

	* Document an undocumented MH feature.  mhn -form mhl.null
	  will suppress the display of the message header.

	* mhparam will now return "mhparam etcdir".

	* Add catproc to /config/config.c and use that in show.c
	  and mshcmds.c, rather than hard coding in /bin/cat.

	* Add mhnproc to the list of `procs' in mh-profile.man.

	* Add configure test for lorder and tsort commands.

	* Commented out the padding in the `msgs` struct in h/mh.h

	* Change m_gmsg.c to allocate elements to the `info' array by
	  500 elements at a time (rather than MAXFOLDERS / 5).

	* Add note to man page for mhmail that zero length messages are
	  not sent.  Need to use -body "" to send empty messages.

	* zotnet/mts/mts.c : compare character with '\0', not NULL.

	* sbr/getcpy.c : assign '\0' to character, not NULL.

	* add m_fmsg to most programs in uip so that they explicitly free
	  folder/message structure when done with folder.

	* uip/slocal.c : cleanup processing of sender.  Make sure it is
	  defined even if message is missing "From " line.

Mon Mar 31 03:37:35 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.10.

	  by default.

Thu Mar 20 03:21:24 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Reversed previous decision to retain "From " lines in slocal.
	  The "From " line is now removed from all messages.

	* inc now saves the date from the "From " envelope in the
	  Delivery-Date header for all messages.

	* sbr/m_getfld.c: Clean up processing of Return-Path and
	  Delivery-Date from the "From " envelope.

Mon Mar 17 19:03:36 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

Thu Mar  6 04:03:24 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Added `-mime' and `-nomime' options to `repl'.
	  From MH-6.8.4 diff.

Tue Mar  4 03:10:37 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* ruserpass.c : removed conflicting prototypes.

	* rcvtty.c : Fixed rcvtty to obey terminal permissions granted
	  by `mesg' command.  Previously only worked on BSD machines.

Mon Mar  3 00:18:59 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* rcvtty.c : Changed to use #define UTMP_FILE (if exists) rather
	  than hard coded "/etc/utmp".

	* Released nmh-0.08.

	* Changed slocal to lock .maildelivery (or file given by -maildelivery)
	  when accessing ndbm/db file for duplicate suppression, instead of
	  locking database itself.

Thu Feb 27 05:28:09 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Added slocal action `mmdf' to deliver to a file in mmdf format.

	* Changed the slocal actions `file' and `>' to always deliver in
	  mbox (uucp) format rather than be determined by RPATHS config
	  option.

	* Changed the slocal action `mbox' to deliver in mbox (uucp) format
	  rather than mmdf format.

	* slocal now adds Delivery-Date field to all messages (previously it
	  only added it to messages when delivering them to a file). The
	  "From " line is now retained on all messages if compiling with
	  RPATHS, rather than being discarded.

	* rcvpack no longer adds the Delivery-Date field to messages.

Sun Feb 23 22:03:54 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Removed the script packmbox, since it's functionality has been
	  added to packf.

	* Changed packf so that it uses mbox (uucp) format by default
	  rather than mmdf format.  Added options -mbox and -mmdf to
	  packf so you can choose the preferred format.

	* Changed rcvpack so that it uses mbox (uucp) format by default
	  rather than mmdf format.  Added options -mbox and -mmdf to
	  rcvpack so you can choose the preferred format.

Tue Feb 18 00:01:05 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed nmh to use dot locking by default (although you
	  can still easily change this in config.h).

	* Simplified locking code.  Removed code allowing setting of
	  locking type in mts.conf.  Now the locking type and locking
	  directory (if any) can only be set at compile time.

Fri Feb 14 02:49:18 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Prefer getting timezone information from tm->gmtoff rather
	  than tzset and external timezone variable.

Thu Feb 13 00:35:45 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Fixed typo in ruserpass.c in the variable toktabs.

	* When ruserpass was added to LIBOBJS, it was missing
	  the suffix.

	* Released nmh-0.07.

Tue Feb 11 01:29:47 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Add check to configure, so that if ruserpass, or _ruserpass
	  is not found, build version of ruserpass in sbr.

	* Added define's to discard.c, m_getfld.c, and scansbr.c so
	  the code that manipulates internals of stdio, will build
	  on SCO 5.x.

	* Added #define to control whether to compile the simple
	  built-in FTP client in mhn.

	* Added configure check for ushort and ulong.  Change code
	  to use ushort/ulong rather than u_short/u_long.

	* A couple of small cleanups in locking code.

	* Added configure check for gmtoff element in struct tm.

	* Added configure check for tzset.

Fri Feb  7 03:01:57 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.06.

	* Removed code for machines that don't have socket
	  interface (how could they get mail anyway?).

	* Removed code for BSD41 machines.  I don't think there are
	  many such machines around anymore.

	* Add configure check for function uname, and prefer it
	  over gethostname.  General cleanup of zotnet/mts/mts.c.

	* Change all `lseek' calls to use POSIX symbolic constants
	  SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, SEEK_END.

Thu Feb  6 01:16:30 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Check lex generated file in zotnet/tws and use
	  pre-generated version if necessary.

	* Released nmh-0.05.

	* Change to use reliable signals on all platforms that have
	  sigaction.  Change so that interrupted system calls are
	  restarted for all signals except SIGALRM.  This fixes alarm
	  handling code in smail.c for BSD based systems.

	* Added lorder and tsort commands so that created libs can
	  be linked in one pass.

Tue Feb  4 01:33:00 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed pidwait so that while it is waiting for a child,
	  it should block signals rather than ignore them.

Mon Feb  3 21:05:30 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Add checks to configure for dbm_open and -lndbm.

Thu Jan 30 05:15:42 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* folder -pop and folder -push were freeing some memory too
	  quickly, which caused the entry popped from the stack to not
	  become the current folder.

Wed Jan 29 01:28:02 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.04.

	* Define ospeed and PC in termsbr.c is OS doesn't have
	  it.

Sun Jan 26 20:25:10 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* editfile will create a symbolic link to the altmsg if it
	  can't make a link, on any machine supporting lstat.  Formerly
	  this would happen only on BSD42 based machines.

Sat Jan 25 22:54:26 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* traverse (in popsbr.c) wasn't calling va_start before using
	  variable argument list.  Fixes core dump in inc when using POP.

Fri Jan 24 03:27:59 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* The variable pass in remotemail needed to be set to
	  NULL.  (From MH-6.8.4 diff).  Fixes core dump of msgchk when
	  using POP.

	* inc and msgchk were using -rpop by default when configured
	  with POP support.  Default is now -norpop.

Thu Jan 23 02:01:17 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* By default, post will now give the SMTP HELO command with
	  the local hostname.  If you specify a hostname with the
	  clientname: option in mts.conf file, post will give the
	  HELO command with that name instead.  If the argument to the
	  clientname: option is empty, no HELO command is given.
	  (From the MH-6.8.4 diff)

Wed Jan 22 01:55:45 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* When using `-help' for a command, it will also print its
	  profile compents from .mh_profile. (From MH-6.8.4 diff)

	* "slocal -file" will now correctly takes its input from
	  a file (currently need to specify full path).

Sun Jan 19 20:37:21 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* "slocal -debug" will now issue a warning if a non-blank
	  line in the .maildelivery file has less than 5 fields.

Sat Jan 18 02:26:41 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed slocal so that code for duplicate suppression
	  (MH config was MSGID) is always built. Added the options
	  -[no]suppressdup to slocal to turn this on/off.

Thu Jan 16 00:26:34 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.03.

	* Fixed problem where mark would core dump if no
	  .mh_sequence file existed.

	* Fixed problem where slocal would core dump if -debug
	  option was given, and certain headers were missing.

	* Added patch to slocal to add `folder' (+) action, which
	  is shorthand for piping message to rcvstore.  Updated
	  man page.

Wed Jan 15 21:30:17 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed flist option -unseen to -[no]all.  Cleaned up
	  flist man page.

Fri Jan 10 20:36:33 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Fixed flist.  Changed the profile component `Folder-Order'
	  to `Flist-Order.  Added option `-sequence' to flist, so
	  you can specify the name of the sequence to search for.

Thu Jan  9 00:20:48 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* A few minor portability cleanups.  Changed to use PATH_MAX
	  rather than MAXPATHLEN.  Don't assume ospeed variable exists
	  in termsbr.c.  Removed some conflicting prototypes.

Wed Jan  8 11:05:02 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Add configure test to check if tgetent will accept NULL
	  and allocate its own buffer.  Borrowed from zsh.

	* Changed libpath to etcpath.

Mon Jan  6 04:15:35 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Cleaned up source code and Makefiles, so that if your `make'
	  supports the VPATH option, you can build nmh in a different
	  directory from where the source code is located.

Fri Jan  3 05:05:18 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Released nmh-0.02.

Wed Jan  1 17:41:52 1997  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Split mhook man page into man pages for rcvdist, rcvpack,
	  and rcvtty.

Tue Dec 31 03:07:48 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed code to use strerror, rather than using sys_errlist
	  and sys_nerr directly.

Mon Dec 30 02:15:25 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* -compat switch from install-mh removed.

	* Changed the default POP port from "pop" to "pop3".

Sat Dec 28 13:25:05 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed mhn_defaults to mhn.defaults.  Changed create_mhn_defaults
	  (again) to mhn.defaults.sh.  Changed find_program (again) to
	  mhn.find.sh.  mhn.defaults.sh now takes the search path
	  as an argument.  Default search path is now specified in Makefile
	  rather than in script.

Fri Dec 27 16:34:01 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed mtstailor file to mts.conf.  Updated man pages.

	* Changed si_value to si_val in mhn.c, since it conflicts with
	  macro defined on Solaris.

Thu Dec 26 02:50:15 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Added --enable-nmh-mhe (and --disable-nmh-mhe) to enable/disable
	  support for Emacs front-end mhe.  It is on by default.

	* Added the following configure options: --enable-nmh-pop to
	  enable client side pop support, --enable-nmh-smtp to enable
	  SMTP support.  Client-side pop support now compiles.  Man
	  pages for inc, msgchk, mh-chart now correctly added pop
	  options if enabled.

Tue Dec 24 14:33:20 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Added configure test for bug in C libraries where linker
	  can't find ruserpass, but can find _ruserpass.

	* Fixed configure test so that termcap variable ospeed is
	  correctly found.

Mon Dec 23 19:40:17 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Source files converted to ANSI C.
	
	* md5 now compiled separately rather than being included
	  in mhn.c.  Changed md5 to use memset and memcpy.

Fri Dec 20 02:29:37 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Collected the error routines adios, advise, admonish, and advertise
	  into one file (error.c), and did some rearranging of the code.

Thu Dec 19 19:05:29 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Added awk script sigmsg.awk (originally written by
	  Geoff Wing <mason@werple.apana.org.au> for zsh) to
	  automatically generate signal messages for pidstatus.c.
	  Added files sbr/signals.c, h/signals.h.  Code now uses
	  sigprocmask to block signals (if available).  Code now uses
	  signal blocking on non-BSD machines.

Wed Dec 18 01:55:17 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Add configure check for ATTVIBUG.  From Soren's mh autoconf work.

	* Released nmh-0.01.

	* Added configure code to check for type of signals functions
	  you have (POSIX or BSD style signals).  Added function
	  SIGPROCMASK to simulate sigprocmask on machines that don't
	  have POSIX signals.

Fri Dec 13 19:40:48 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Added -version switch to all commands.  Also added to
	  their man pages.

Mon Dec  9 16:36:54 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Renamed uip/trmsbr.c to termsbr.c and changed it to use
	  POSIX termios.h style functions if present.

Tue Dec  3 16:18:39 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Changed support/general/bootmhn.sh to output new mhn_defaults
	  file to standard output by default (makes it easier for testing).
	  Changed name of script to create_mhn_defaults.  Changed bootmhn.findit
	  script to find_program.

Sun Dec  1 10:00:00 1996  Richard Coleman  <coleman@math.gatech.edu>

	* Added patch to uip/folder.c from exmh distribution to
	  speed up -recurse option.

	* Added flist command from exmh distribution.  It doesn't work
	  yet, but it compiles :-)

	* Changed default location for install to /usr/local/nmh/{bin,etc,lib,man}.
	  Split files so that format and configuration files go in nmh/etc, and
	  support binaries go in nmh/lib.  Of course, all this can now be changed
	  in the top level Makefile.

	* Started with mh-6.8.3 as based and converted to autoconf.
	  Rewrote all the Makefiles.  Currently only works with sendmail/smtp.
	  Pop support and plenty of other things, are now broken.
