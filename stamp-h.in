Just adding some text to this file so that cvs will see a difference and let me check it in.  Every time acconfig.h or configure.in are changed (which I just
did), the timestamp on this file needs to be updated or when people do a make
an unnecessary `cd . && autoheader` will be done, and not everybody has the
autoconf tools installed.  The next person to change those two files (or
aclocal.m4) will need to change this text, maybe just to a message saying which
dependency files were changed and by whom.
