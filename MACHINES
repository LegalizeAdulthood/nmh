FreeBSD:
OpenBSD:
NetBSD:

Some BSD4.4 machines have problems when running nmh's configure script.
They will be unable to find the location of vi and sendmail.  This is
due to POSIX features (breakage?) in the shell sh.  The solution is to
run the configure script under the shell `bash'

bash configure

--------------------------------------

HPUX:

Lots of problems have been reported with using HPUX `cc'.  In particular,
problems with `scan' giving incorrect dates (everything is 01/00).
It is highly recommended that you use `gcc' instead.

Also, new versions of HPUX (10.20?) will core dump in `scan' because
of some workaround code in zotnet/tws/lexstring.c.  This workaround is
needed for older versions of HPUX, but causes problems on newer versions.
The solution is the added the line

#undef hpux

after line 15 of the file zotnet/tws/lexstring.c.

--------------------------------------

Irix (SGI):

If you are compiling nmh with POP support, then the configuration
process will search for (and find) the Irix version of "ruserpass".
Unfortunately, this version is buggy and causes core dumps.  The best
bet is to use the version that comes with nmh.  After running configure,
edit the Makefile in the "sbr" directory, and add "ruserpass.o" to the
LIBOBJS line.  Then run "make" as normal.

--------------------------------------

Linux:

Make sure you uncomment the Linux section in the config.h file after
running configure.

The configuration script does a test to discover the functions
sigsetjmp/siglongjmp.  Since they are macros on Linux, the configuration
process doesn't find them.  After running configure, you should change
the line in config.h to define HAVE_SIGSETJMP.

For some Linux distributions, the configure script doesn't find the
ndbm/gdbm library (dbm_open, dbm_close).  In this case, you should try to
configure nmh like this:

    LIBS=-lgdbm ./configure [configure options]

The configuration script does a test to discover if your vi is broken
(if it reports non-zero exit codes on certain pseudo-errors).  This test
will hang if the program `ex' on your system is a link to the vi clone
`vile'.  The workaround is to replace the command ex as a link to another
vi clone such as nvi or elvis.

--------------------------------------

SCO:

Make sure you uncomment the SCO section in the config.h file after
running configure.

--------------------------------------

Solaris:

Builds ok.

--------------------------------------

SunOS 4.1.3:

You can't use the C compiler that comes with SunOS 4.1.3 since
it isn't ANSI C.  But nmh builds just fine with gcc.
