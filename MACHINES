nmh is known to compile on the following platforms (save the
exceptions noted below), using an ANSI C compiler, such as gcc.

AIX 4.1.5.0.01
Cygwin (setup version 2.831, other versions may be fine)
FreeBSD
IRIX 6.5
Linux 2.2 to current (glibc 2.1 to current)
Mac OS X
NetBSD 1.4.2
OpenBSD
Solaris 7 and 8 (sparc,x86)
SunOS 4.1

Known Compilation problems:
--------------------------------------
Cygwin:

Be sure to install these Cygwin packages (or later versions):
  libdb4.8
  libdb4.8-devel
  libgdbm-devel
  libncurses-devel

Some versions of libncurses-devel do not install /usr/include/curses.h,
/usr/include/term.h, and /usr/include/termcap.h.  If yours does not,
add /usr/include/ symlinks to those files in /usr/include/ncurses/.

The database packages are only used by slocal(1).

If configuring with --with-cyrus-sasl, install these Cygwin packages:
  libsasl2
  libsasl2-devel

If configuring with --with-tls, install this Cygwin package (or a
later version):
  libgnutls28

When running the nmh test suite ("make check"), it helps to have
/usr/bin/ ahead of any Windows directories on your PATH.

Note that the -link switch to refile cannot be used on FAT32 and
similar filesystems.

--------------------------------------
HPUX:

Lots of problems have been reported with using HPUX `cc'.  In particular,
problems with `scan' giving incorrect dates (everything is 01/00).
It is highly recommended that you use `gcc' instead.

Also, new versions of HPUX (10.20?) will core dump in `scan' because
of some workaround code in zotnet/tws/lexstring.c.  This workaround is
needed for older versions of HPUX, but causes problems on newer versions.
The solution is the added line (minus our indentation):

    #undef hpux

after line 15 of the file zotnet/tws/lexstring.c.

--------------------------------------
Irix (SGI):

Irix make is notoriously buggy. If you're using it, you should "touch
config.h.in" before configuring to prevent a problem where it tries to
rebuild targets that shouldn't be rebuilt. (Alternately, you can just
use GNU make instead of Irix make.)

--------------------------------------
Linux:

These packages are required at runtime:
  ncurses-libs
  libdb (only for slocal(1))
  cyrus-sasl-lib (if configured with --with-cyrus-sasl)
  gnutls (if configured with --with-tls)

For building, these packages are required:
  ncurses-devel
  libdb-devel (only for slocal(1))
  gdbm-devel (only for slocal(1))

If configuring with --with-cyrus-sasl, install these packages:
  cyrus-sasl-lib-devel

--------------------------------------
Solaris:

With --enable-debug you'll see a lot of warnings. This is even worse
when compiling using the Sun Workshop compiler since it issues a
warning for every instance of a problem instead of summarizing them.
The main one concerns arrays with an index of type char. This is ok.
The array itself is a hash of chars, so the array size and the type
match. There isn't another safe and portable way to do this at the
moment. An explicit cast would get rid of the warnings, but I think
it's better to leave it complaining for now until we come up with
a better solution. The whole thing is probablly going to be chucked
with UTF-8 support anyway.

Other than the warnings, it builds ok.

--------------------------------------
SunOS 4.1.1/4.1.3/4.1.4:

You can't use the C compiler that comes with SunOS 4 since
it isn't ANSI C.  But nmh builds just fine with gcc. With
--enable-debug you will see a lot of warnings.
